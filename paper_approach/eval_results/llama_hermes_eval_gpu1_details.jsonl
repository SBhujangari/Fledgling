As writers, it is a powerful tool to be able to move back and forth between stylistic modes and communication styles--the better to reach our readers. The following elements of style (in alphabetical order) are just some of the areas where you can make these writerly choices. \n##### Concise Writing \n Concision is the opposite of wordiness. Concise writing is tight and bright; it is clear and content-rich. In other words, it contains no additional fluff or unnecessary words. Why is fluff a problem, at a sentence or paragraph level? Why does this matter, do you think? In the worst cases, wordiness leads to whole paragraphs of fluff and repetition. Sometimes this happens when students are asked to meet a page-length requirement for an assignment. \"How can I possibly write five to six pages about the Endangered Species Act?\" you may wonder. That's a great question and one you could work on with your instructor--but the answer should ultimately boil down to better content, not fluff paragraphs. (A few ideas: add a counterargument, bring in another source, give an example, ask a more complex question, etc.) A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 202 \nIn most writing, though, wordiness happens unconsciously. The kinds of extra words that we add in conversation can make a written sentence confusing and less impactful. Because writing is a more crafted form of communication, we can take the time to edit ourselves and remove the fluff for a stronger final product. Consider the following examples: _Wordy:_ The author of this article, Dr. Belinda Jackson, who is a psychologist and researches cognition, makes the argument that metacognition is very helpful for student learning. _Concise:_ Cognitive psychologist Dr. Belinda Jackson argues that metacognition improves student learning. Notice that the _content_ of the sentence didn't change. Concision is not about simplifying your ideas or removing important details. Instead, the goal is to remove unnecessary words that dilute or confuse the sentence. A more concise sentence is easier to understand and therefore makes a stronger impact. In fact, it leaves room for _more_ content: a concise writer can pack an incredible amount of information and ideas into a paragraph. Conciseness is an ongoing exercise for all writers. Here are a few tips to make your writing more concise:  Remove unnecessary repetition. For example, a \"slow, unhurried, leisurely stroll\" could be rewritten as simply \"a leisurely stroll.\"  Remove empty modifiers--adjectives and adverbs that don't significantly contribute to the meaning of the sentence and are used only to intensify the word they are modifying. The most common ones are _very, really, pretty, totally,_ and _just_.  Use an active voice when it makes sense to do so. More on this in the \"Passive and Active Voice\" section below.  Combine sentences to avoid repetition. For example, this version is wordy: \"I went to the store. The store was Winco. They were closed.\" A more concise version would be \"I went to Winco, but they were closed.\" Notice that concise writing does not always mean short, simple sentences. As Strunk and White put it in their famous book _The Elements of Style_ , That's a high bar but something to aspire to as you work to make your writing concise and content-rich. Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell. (46) 203 COLLECTED WORKS \n##### Correctness \n Many writers feel concerned about \"grammar\" (I used quote marks here because often what they really mean is clarity, syntax, punctuation, or even spelling--any kind of English usage or mechanics). Often, these writers have been told that their writing contains errors or that it's difficult to understand. This can happen for many reasons. Knowledge of mechanics and English usage comes from a combination of the language or dialect you spoke growing up, the way you process language, your exposure to written language, and more. This anxiety can be exacerbated by encounters with \"grammar Nazis\"--people who take it upon themselves to get out their (literal or figurative) red pen and tell you (and the world) exactly what you've done wrong. You may have a grammar stickler in your own life, and the internet is certainly full of them. We've all seen the correction *you're as a saucy retort to haters in the comments section (one of the most satisfying and, it has to be said, pedantic responses out there). The internet itself--and all digital communication--is a great example of how language and English usage are constantly in flux. How often do you see a period at the end of a text message--and if you do, what did you do to make the writer angry? How long has the phrase \"because internet\" been considered a complete thought? Internet linguistics is fascinating in its own right, but I bring it up here as an example of a larger point: grammar is made up. Yes, there are some stylistic and usage choices that make our meaning clearer and more graceful, but some rules are arbitrary and were invented by eighteenthand nineteenth-century grammarians. (\"Never end a sentence with a preposition,\" I'm looking at you--an arbitrary rule if I ever heard one.) There is something to be said for correctness. Errors can distract readers from ideas or make meaning murky, and it is true that others may judge us (again, unfairly) for errors and typos in our emails. (Interestingly, one study suggests that the people most bothered by these kinds of errors are not united by age, education, or time spent reading; instead, their commonality is personality type. Extroverts are more willing to overlook written errors that introverted people may judge negatively [Boland and Queen].) In the field of rhetoric and composition, though, we have moved away from a heavy emphasis on correct usage in the past few years. While there is value in correctness, the most important thing is for your meaning to be clear and your ideas to be sound. Too much focus on where the apostrophe goes can detract from the larger issues of how to build an argument, support a stance, or structure an essay. We need to work on those global aspects of writing before getting down to the nitty-gritty of comma usage. As Stephen Pinker put it, For all the vitriol brought out by matters of correct usage, they are the smallest part of good writing. They pale in importance behind coherence, classic style and overcoming the curse of knowledge, to say nothing of standards of intellectual conscientiousness. If you really want to improve the quality of your writing, or if you want to thunder about sins in the writing of others, the principles you should worry about the most are not the ones that govern fused participles and possessive antecedents but the ones that govern critical thinking and factual diligence. (485) A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 204 \n In other words, grammar and usage are only a small part of the larger writing picture. Your instructor may note patterns of error or point out places where a comma would make your writing clearer--but it will not be the primary focus of most college writing classes. However, when you leave school, it will be up to you to judge the rhetorical situation of any piece of writing and handle correctness accordingly. You already know this subconsciously; just think again about the example of texting a friend versus emailing an instructor. English usage and mechanics are another way to make your writing more effective, powerful, and clear. Think of them as tools to help you strengthen the rhetorical impact of your words and ideas. How can you use these tools to clarify your meaning and help your readers focus on the good stuff? See the \"Additional Resources\" and \"Activities\" sections for more practical and specific guidance on comma usage and more. \n##### Passive And Active Voice \n Maybe this is a familiar phrase: \"Ugh, he's so passive! Why won't he speak up for himself?\" When we describe a person as passive, we mean that they let things happen to them. They don't take action; instead, they allow things to happen without resistance. That definition is helpful when learning about passive voice in writing as well. In passive voice, the object (or recipient) of the action becomes the subject of the sentence. In other words, the focus is on who (or what) received the action rather than on who (or what) completed the action. Here's an example to show you what I mean: Passive: The coffee was drunk by Poppy. Active: Poppy drank the coffee. Both of these sentences are grammatically correct, but as you can see, they have some notable differences. The passive construction is a little longer, and it emphasizes the coffee (the recipient of the action) rather than Poppy (the doer of the action). The active version is more concise, and it focuses on Poppy and her actions. These may seem like small differences, but they add up over the course of a paper. Active voice is often considered sharper, clearer, and cleaner than passive voice. In the example above, you can see why. So why would anyone ever use passive voice? Well, in some cases, the doer of the action is unknown or irrelevant, as in \"The package was delivered this morning\" (passive). We don't know who delivered it, and while the delivery person matters as a human, they don't matter in the meaning of this sentence. In other cases, the receiver of the action is more important than the doer; we emphasize the recipient of the action because that's what matters in the context of the sentence. For example, we almost always say, \"She was born in 1994,\" which is a passive construction. In this situation, who did the action (her mother) is not the most relevant information. If we wrote, \"Her mother gave birth to her in 1994\" (active voice), we would be making a conscious decision to highlight her mother's role in the moment. 205 COLLECTED WORKS \n This is often true in technical and scientific writing as well, which is why the passive voice is more common in STEM fields. In a lab report, for example, the experiment is more important than the researcher; for that reason, it's common to write in the passive voice. For example, \"Hydrochloric acid was then added\" (passive) is more common than \"I added hydrochloric acid.\" We also often use passive voice to avoid blaming others in a negative situation. In some cases, this is considered the most polite route. It may feel accusatory or aggressive to say, \"You did this assignment incorrectly\" (active). Instead, we might say, \"This assignment was done incorrectly.\" Again, both are correct, but we can make a writerly choice here to focus on the receiver of the action (the assignment) and in this case spare someone's feelings. However, be careful! The passive voice is sometimes used in this way to avoid taking responsibility. Newspapers famously use passive voice in a way that emphasizes the victims rather than the criminals. Politicians, corporations, and regular people also use the passive voice to duck blame or responsibility. Consider the following examples: Passive: She was assaulted at a party. Active: An unknown male assaulted her at a party. Passive: Authors of color have been historically marginalized by the publishing industry. Active: Historically, the publishing industry marginalized authors of color. Passive: Mistakes were made. Active: We made a mistake. (Or even more unthinkable: I made a mistake.) How does the active voice shift the focus of the sentence and potentially the cultural framing of sexual assault, racism, and other errors? You can see how the use of active or passive voice can be a political choice as well as a stylistic one. Passive voice isn't grammatically incorrect, and it has its place. The key (as with all elements of style) is to consider how its use impacts your writing. Notice it and make a choice about when to use it and when to cut it. You can check your own writing for passive voice. Does the \"doer\" of the action come after the action (the thing that was done)? Or does the doer disappear completely? If so, the sentence is likely in a passive voice. You can also look for this construction in your sentences: \n##### Point Of View: To \"I\" Or Not To \"I\" \n As a general rule, an \"I\" voice will give your writing a more personal and subjective feel. That's why a first-person perspective is common in memoirs and personal essays but rarely seen in STEM fields (although some scientific articles do refer to the researchers as \"we,\" which is a personal pronoun but somehow slightly less intimate than \"I\"). Academic writing in the humanities and social sciences is somewhere in between these two extremes--depending on the subject and context, a writer can make their own choice. Many well-known scholars in these fields use an \"I\" in their academic papers, especially if their connection to the subject \n### \"TO BE\" VERB (IS, ARE, WAS, ETC.) + \n### PAST PARTICIPLE (WALKED, TAKEN, \n### SEEN, ETC.) = PASSIVE VOICE \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 206 \n is important to understanding their perspective or point. Some authors use it just a little bit--maybe they open their article with a personal anecdote before moving into a more objective tone--while others use it throughout a piece of writing. It's worth noting that although writing without the \"I\" can be read as more objective, all writing is created by people with perspectives and stances. If I make an argument, it doesn't matter if I frame it with \"I argue\" or not; it's still my argument. From one perspective, then, using an \"I\" voice is simply more transparent about the subjectivity of the work. The \"I\" voice is slightly less formal, although it can still have a place in academic writing. It can also feel quite personal, depending on the subject.

This last point is often not fully appreciated, leading to errors. Be careful not to cavalierly add the cardinalities of nonmutually-exclusive sets! You'll end up double-counting items. \nSo we know that the number of possible license plates is equal to: \n the # of 7-character plates + the # of 6-character plates + the # of 5-character plates + * * * + the # of 1-character plates. \nVery well. We can now figure out each one separately. How do we know how many 7-character plates there are? Well, if every character must be either a letter or a digit, then we have 26 + 10 = 36 choices for each character. This implies 367 different possible 7-character license plates. The total number of plates is therefore: \n 367 + 36^6 + 36^5 + 36^4 + 36^3 + 36^2 + 36 = 80,603,140,212 plates \nwhich is about ten times the population of the earth, so I think we're safe for now. \n6.1. THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM 145 \nHere's an interesting thought experiment to test your intuition about numbers. Look at the above calculation, and ask yourself: \"what if the state of Virginia decided, for purposes of consistency, that all license plates _had_ to have the full 7 characters? Would that significantly reduce the total number of possible plates?\" My first inclination would be to say \"yes,\" because we're adding seven things in that equation, and if we mandated 7-character plates for everyone we'd eliminate 6 out of the 7. Surely we'd be in danger of running out of license plates to give to all the cars! But in fact the new total number of plates would turn out to be: \n 367 = 78,364,164,096 plates. \nWow. We've hardly lost _anything_ by scrapping all the less-than-7character plates. Turns out that in comparison with the 7-character plates, all the other lengths were a drop in the bucket. This is a powerful illustration of exponential growth. When you modify the exponent, going from something like 366 to 367 , you get astronomically larger very, very quickly. This is a good thing to know when all you want is an approximation of some quantity. How many passwords are possible in a system that mandates 6-10 characters per password? Well, you can pretty much ignore all the 6-9 character passwords and just count the 10-character passwords, because there are so many more of those. \nOne last tweak to the license plate example before we move on. Suppose (again, for the sake of consistency) that Virginia outlawed personalized plates and gave everyone a randomly generated 7-character plate. Furthermore, the last four characters of the plate had to be _digits_ instead of letters, so that something like \"RFP-6YQ7\" would be impossible. Now how many possible plates would there be? \nIn this case, not each of the k parts of n have an equal number of choices. n 1 through n 3 are still 36, but now n 4 through n 7 are just \n10. So this gives us: \n 36 x 36 x 36 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 466,560,000 plates \n146 CHAPTER 6. COUNTING \nor only about .006 times as many as before. Better stick with alphanumeric characters for all seven positions. \n**A simple trick** \nSometimes we have something difficult to count, but we can turn it around in terms of something much easier. Often this involves counting the _complement_ of something, then subtracting from the total. \nFor instance, suppose a certain website mandated that user passwords be between 6-10 characters in length -- every character being an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, digit, or special character (*, #, @, % or &) -- but it also required each password to have _at least one digit or special character._ How many passwords are possible? \nWithout the \"at least one digit or special character\" part, it's pretty easy: there are 26 + 26 + 10 + 5 = 67 different choices for each character, so we have \n 6710 + 67^9 + 67^8 + 67^7 + 67^6 = 1,850,456,557,795,600,384 strings. \nBut how do we handle the \"at least one\" part? \nOne way would be to list all the possible ways of having a password with at least one non-alpha character. The non-alpha could appear in the first position, or the second, or the third,... , or the tenth, but of course this only works for 10-digit passwords, and in any event it's not like the _other_ characters couldn't _also_ be non-alpha. It gets messy really fast. \nThere's a simple trick, though, once you realize that it's easy to count the passwords that _don't_ satisfy the extra constraint. Ask yourself this question: out of all the possible strings of 6-10 characters, how many of them _don't_ have at least one non-alpha character? (and are therefore illegal, according to the website rules?) \nIt turns out that's the same as asking \"how many strings are there with 6-10 alphabetic (only) characters?\" which is of course: \n 5210 + 52^9 + 52^8 + 52^7 + 52^6 = 147,389,519,403,536,384 (illegal) passwords. \n6.2. PERMUTATIONS 147 \nNow, all we have to do is subtract to get \ntotal # of strings - # of illegal passwords = # of legit passwords 1,850,456,557,795,600,384 - 147,389,519,403,536,384 = 1,708,735,865,301,022,720 \nlegitimate passwords. Looks like we don't lose much by requiring the non-alpha character. \nThe lesson learned is that if counting the elements in some set involves accounting for a lot of different sticky scenarios, it's worth a try to count the elements _not_ in the set instead, and see if that's easier. \n**6.2 Permutations** \nWhen we're counting things, we often run into permutations. A **permutation** of n distinct objects is an arrangement of them in a sequence. For instance, suppose all three Davies kids need to brush their teeth, but only one of them can use the sink at a time. What order will they brush in? One possibility is Lizzy, then T.J., then Johnny. Another possibility is T.J., then Lizzy, then Johnny. Another is Johnny, then Lizzy, then T.J. These are all different permutations of the Davies kids. Turns out there are six of them (find all 6 for yourself!) \nCounting the number of permutations is just a special application of the Fundamental Theorem of Counting. For the teeth brushing example, we have n = 3 different \"parts\" to the problem, each of which has ni choices to allocate to it. There are three different Davies kids who could brush their teeth first, so n 1 = 3. Once that child is chosen, there are then _two_ remaining children who could brush second, so n 2 = 2. Then, once we've selected a first-brusher and a second-brusher, there's only one remaining choice for the third-brusher, so n 3 = 1. This means the total number of possible brushing orders is: \n 3 x 2 x 1 = 6. \n148 CHAPTER 6. COUNTING \nThis pattern comes up so much that mathematicians have established a special notation for it: \n n x (n - 1) x (n - 2) x * * * x 1 = n! (\"n-factorial\") \nWe say there are \"3-factorial\" different brushing orders for the Davies kids. For our purposes the notion of factorial will only apply for integers, so there's no such thing as 23.46! or p!. (In advanced computer science applications, however, mathematicians sometimes do define factorial for non-integers.) We also define 0! to be 1, which might surprise you. \nThis comes up a heck of a lot. If I give you a jumbled set of letters to unscramble, like \"KRIBS\" (think of the Jumble(r)^ word game in the newspaper), how many different unscramblings are there? The answer is 5!, or 120, one of which is BRISK. Let's say I shuffle a deck of cards before playing War.^2 How many different games of War are there? The answer is 52!, since any of the cards in the deck might be shuffled on top, then any _but_ that top card could be second, then any _but_ those two could be third, _etc._ Ten packets arrive near-simultaneously at a network router. How many ways can they be queued up for transmission? 10! ways, just like a larger Davies family. \nThe factorial function grows really, really fast, by the way, even faster than exponential functions. A five letter word like \"BRISK\" has 120 permutations, but \"AMBIDEXTROUSLY\" has 87,178,291,200, ten times the population of the earth. The number of ways to shuffle a deck is \n80,658,175,170,944,942,408,940,349,866,698,506,766,127,860,028,660,283,290,685,487,972,352 \nso I don't think my boys will end up playing the same War game twice any time soon, nor my wife and I the same bridge hand. \n(^2) \"War\" is a mindless card game which involves no strategy or decisionmaking on the part of the players. Once you shuffle the initial deck, the entire outcome of the game is fixed. \n6.2. PERMUTATIONS 149 \n**Enumerating permutations** \nWe've discovered that there are 120 permutations of BRISK, but how would we go about listing them all? You can play around with the Davies kids and stumble upon all 6 permutations, but for larger numbers it's harder. We need a systematic way. \nTwo of the easiest ways to enumerate permutations involve recursion. Here's one: \n**Algorithm #1 for enumerating permutations** \n1. Begin with a set of n objects. \n a) If n = 1, there is only one permutation; namely, the object itself. b) Otherwise, remove one of the objects, and find the permutations of the remaining n - 1 objects. Then, insert the removed object at every possible position, creating another permutation each time. \nAs always with recursion, solving a bigger problem depends on solving smaller problems. Let's start with RISK. We've already discovered from the toothbrushing example that the permutations of ISK are ISK, IKS, SIK, SKI, KIS, and KSI. So to find the permutations of RISK, we insert an R into _each_ possible location for _each_ of these ISK-permutations. This gives us: \n R ISK I R SK IS R K ISK R R IKS I R KS IK R S IKS R R SIK * * * \n150 CHAPTER 6. COUNTING \nand so on. Once we have the RISK permutations, we can generate the BRISK permutations in the same way: \n B RISK R B ISK RI B SK RIS B K RISK B B IRSK I B RSK IR B SK IRS B K IRSK B B RSIK * * * \nAnother algorithm to achieve the same goal (though in a different order) is as follows: \n**Algorithm #2 for enumerating permutations** \n1. Begin with a set of n objects. \n a) If n = 1, there is only one permutation; namely, the object itself. b) Otherwise, remove each of the objects in turn, and prepend that object to the permutations of all the others, creating another permutation each time. \nI find this one a little easier to get my head around, but in the end it's personal preference. The permutations of BRISK are: \"B followed by all the permutations of RISK, plus R followed by all the permutations of BISK, plus I followed by all the permutations of BRSK, _etc._ \" So the first few permutations of a 4-letter word are: \n R I S K R I K S R S I K \n6.2. PERMUTATIONS 151 \n R S K I R K I S R K S I I R S K I R K S I S R K I S K R I K R S I K S R S R I K * * * \nThen, for the 5-letter word: \n B R I S K B R I K S B R S I K B R S K I B R K I S B R K S I B I R S K B I R K S * * * \n**Partial permutations** \nSometimes we want to count the permutations of a set, but only want to choose _some_ of the items each time, not all of them. For example, consider a golf tournament in which the top ten finishers (out of 45) all receive prize money, with the first place winner receiving the most, the second place finisher a lesser amount, and so on down to tenth place, who receives a nominal prize. How many different finishes are possible to the tournament? \nIn this case, we want to know how many different orderings of golfers there are, but it turns out that past tenth place, we don't care what order they finished in. All that matters is the first ten places. If the top ten are 1.Tiger, 2.Phil, 3.Lee, 4.Rory,... , and \n152 CHAPTER 6.

This last point is often not fully appreciated, leading to errors. Be careful not to cavalierly add the cardinalities of nonmutually-exclusive sets!

We can now figure out each one separately. How do we know how many 7-character plates there are? Well, if every character must be either a letter or a digit, then we have 26 + 10 = 36 choices for each character. This implies 367 different possible 7-character license plates. The total number of plates is therefore: \n 367 + 36^6 + 36^5 + 36^4 + 36^3 + 36^2 + 36 = 80,603,140,212 plates \nwhich is about ten times the population of the earth, so I think we're safe for now. \n6.1.

I've found that students go through a layered understanding of a prompt, at first understanding the basic concept and then looking more carefully at the prompt's specific requirements. But what makes their papers far more effective is if they can take ownership of the prompt--in other words, if they can consider a way of making it more than simply an assignment, making it an opportunity for them to address an issue they are passionate about to a specific audience. To help them develop this sense of audience and purpose, a discussion of exigency can be beneficial. This is one reason to talk about exigency at the beginning of the writing project. The discussion about it will differ depending on how narrowly their purpose and audience are being defined by the writing prompt, but either way, the beginning of the project is the first and probably best place to discuss exigency. \n#### WORKS CITED \n#### TEACHER RESOURCES FOR EXIGENCY: WHAT MAKES MY \n#### MESSAGE INDISPENSABLE TO MY READER BY QUENTIN VIEREGGE \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 114 \n It can also be helpful to discuss exigency when students are writing their introductory paragraphs or concluding paragraphs or as they are revising their drafts to craft a more compelling argument. These three points in the composition process are what I think of as global points, where students have an opportunity to look at the writing assignment holistically. As a reader--in and out of the classroom--the introduction and conclusion are often where I find exigent moments, and I tell students this, perhaps bringing in examples for them to review and discuss. As a writer, it's often in the middle or at the end of the writing process that I can better grasp the exigency of an argument for both myself and my readers, and this can be a point of discussion in class as well. As my chapter asserts, asking students to think in terms of author and reader personas may also help lead to discussions on exigency. Asking students to think of personas invites them to consider what agenda or values correspond with that persona and how those considerations can help writers establish connections with their readers. Finally, exigency isn't just connected to global issues like persona, audience, and purpose; it can also be thought of in terms of templates and well-worn rhetorical moves. Showing students rhetorical patterns connected to exigency, such as how writers explain a \"gap in the research,\" can help make it clear how they can articulate exigency at the sentence or passage level. \n##### DISCUSSION QUESTIONS \n1.

What writers need is revision. Novice writers, experienced writers, all writers. Anyone interested in writing clearer, stronger, more persuasive and passionate prose, even those of us who are procrastinators panicking because we need to get a project finished or a paper written and it's 2:00 a.m. the night before our deadline--writers need revision because revision is not a discrete step. Revision is not the thing writers do when they're done writing. Revision is the writing. It's important to keep in mind I'm not talking about revision as proofreading or copyediting; no amount of grammatical, spelling, and style corrections transforms a piece of writing like focused attention to fundamental questions about purpose, evidence, and organization. That, to me, is revision: the heavy lifting of working through why I'm writing, who I'm writing for, and how I structure writing logically and effectively. My writing students are usually relieved to hear that published authors often find writing just as fraught as they do. Like college students, people paid to write--the journalists and the novelists and the technical writers--more often than not despair at the difference between what's in their heads and hearts and what ends up on the page the first time around. The professionals are just a little better at waiting things out, pushing through what Anne Lamott calls \"shitty first drafts\" and all the ones that follow, the revision of a tenth and a thirteenth and a twenty-third draft. In class, I show a YouTube video by Tim Weninger, a computer scientist and engineer at the University of Notre Dame. In the video, Weninger stitches together his revisions of a research paper. In my class, we play a game, guessing how many revisions Weninger did. The answer--463!--almost always surprises them. It still sometimes surprises me. And sure, some of those revisions are small, fiddly changes. But most of the time, even watching this quickly on classroom monitors, my students notice Weninger aims for the jugular in his writing. He's after a wholesale overhaul of his argument and of his larger work. \n#### REVISION IS WRITING \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 116 \n However, talking about revision in terms of numbers of drafts implies that all writing, all writers, and all revision work one way: hit your target draft number, like your daily Fitbit goals, and you magically get good writing. But more revision isn't necessarily better. Effective revising isn't making changes for the sake of change but instead making smarter changes. And professional writers--practiced writers--have this awareness even if they aren't aware of it. In Stephen King's memoir On Writing , he calls this instinct the ideal reader: an imagined person a writer knows and trusts but rewrites in response to, a kind of collaborative dance between writer and reader. To writers, the act of writing is an act of thinking. One writer in a landmark study comparing the habits of experienced writers to those of novices called their first drafts \"the kernel.\" If you're someone like me who is constantly struggling to demystify this complex cognitive thing we humans do, that metaphor of writing as a seed is revelatory. Revision is not a sign of weakness or inexperience or poor writing. It is the writing. The more writers push through chaos to get to the good stuff, the more they revise. The more writers revise, whether that be the keystrokes they sweat in front of a blinking, demanding cursor or the unofficial revising they do in our heads when they're showering or driving or running, the more the ideal reader becomes a part of their craft and muscle memory, of who they are as writers, so at some point, they may not know where the writing stops and the revision begins. Because writing and revision are impossible to untangle, revision is just as situational and interpretive as writing. In other words, writers interact with readers--writing and revision are social, responsive, and communal. Take Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech. King gave a rough draft of the most famous American speech of the twentieth century to eighteen hundred people crammed into a gymnasium in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, in November of \n1962. Seven months later, King gave another revision of the speech to a gathering of political and spiritual leaders, musicians, and activists in Detroit. In August of 1963, in front of the Lincoln Memorial, King riffed and reworked and rebuilt what he preached in Rocky Mount and Detroit, ad-libbing, deleting, and flipping lines. \"I Have a Dream\" is what Americans remember today, engraved in our collective memories, archives, and textbooks as a symbol of an entire era, but King's famous refrain singing his vision for a less racially divided country was not even part of his speech's official text that day. Was King writing a new speech? Was he done with the Rocky Mount or Detroit one? \"I Have a Dream\" was not one speech but many, written and rewritten. King was not content to let his words sit, but like any practiced writer working out his muscles, he revised and riffed, adapting it for new audiences and purposes. All this revision talk could lead to the counterargument that revision is a death spiral, a way of shoving off the potential critique of a finished draft forever. Tinkering is something we think of as quaint but not very efficient. Writers can always make the excuse that something is a work in progress, that they just don't have time for all this revision today. But this critique echoes the point that writing is social and responsive to its readers. Writing is almost always meant to be read and responded to, not hoarded away. A recent large-scale study on writing's impact on learning supports the idea that specific interventions in the writing process matter more in learning to write rather than how much \n#### REVISION: ALIVE AND KICKING \n 117 COLLECTED WORKS \nstudents are writing (Anderson et al.). Among these useful interventions are participation in a lively revision culture and an interactive and social writing process such as talking over drafts--soliciting feedback from instructors and classmates. Extending the modern definition of writing more broadly to composing in any medium, revision is as bound to writing as breathing is to living. If anything, humans are doing more writing and revision today. Sure, there are people who call themselves writers and mean that it is part of their formal job title. But then there are the greater numbers of us who are writers but don't label ourselves as such, the millions of us just noodling around on Facebook or Snapchat or Instagram. Facebook and Instagram have an edit feature on posts. Google Docs includes a revision history tool. When we send a text and our buzzy little e-devices kick in with autocorrect, changing Linkin Park to Kinky Park, we compensate with frantic asterisks. We edit our comments or return to clarify them; we cannot resist. Revision as writing is an idea that we should not abandon or trash--and it may not even be possible to do so if we tried. The original chapter, Strong Writing and Writers Don't Need Revision by Laura Giovanelli, is from Bad Ideas about Writing \n**1.** One of the headings in this essay is a common saying in the field of rhetoric     and composition: \"revision is writing\" (or sometimes \"writing is revision\").     What does this mean? What does this perspective suggest about the     writing process or how experienced writers write? \n**2.** What revision strategies have you used in the past? What has been     effective for you? \n**3.** What gets in the way of revision?

How does Birbiglia's process compare or contrast with           what we know of Dr. King's?         Do a little research on other stand-up comedians'           processes. What surprises you about what you learn?           What can you take away? \n**2.** Choose one revision strategy that's new to you (either from discussion in     class or from your own research). Try it out with your own draft. Write a     paragraph reflecting on the process. What surprised you? What did you     learn through this process? In what ways was it helpful, and in what ways     was it not? Will you use it again? \n#### ACTIVITIES \n119 COLLECTED WORKS \n**1.** For more about the relationships between revision, writing experience, and     writing processes, see Alice Horning and Anne Becker's _Revision: History,_     _Theory, and Practice_ (Parlor Press) and Linda Adler-Kassner and Elizabeth     Wardle's _Naming What We Know: Threshold Concepts of Writing Studies_ (Utah     State University Press), specifically Doug Downs's chapter, \"Revision Is     Central to Developing Writing.\" \n**2.** Just a handful of many important studies that have helped writing scholars     better understand what's going on when writers revise are Nancy     Sommers's \"Revision Strategies of Student Writers and Experienced     Writers\"; Lester Faigley and Stephen Witte's \"Analyzing Revision\"; Mina     Shaughnessy's _Errors and Expectations: A Guide for the Teacher of Basic_     _Writing_ (Oxford University Press); and Paul Anderson, Chris Anson, Charles     Paine, and Robert M.

Heavy lines indicate edges that have been (irrevocably) added to the set. \n5.2. TREES 111 \nyou think that the shortest path between any two nodes would land right on this Prim network? Yet if you compare Figure 5.14 with Figure 5.13 you'll see that the quickest way from Bordeaux to Strasbourg is through Marseille, not Vichy. \nSo we end up with the remarkable fact that the shortest route between two points has nothing whatsoever to do with the shortest _total_ distance between _all_ points. Who knew? \n**5.2 Trees** \nA tree is really nothing but a simplification of a graph. There are two kinds of trees in the world: free trees, and rooted trees.^4 \n**Free trees** \nA **free tree** is just a connected graph with no cycles. Every node is reachable from the others, and there's only one way to get anywhere. Take a look at Figure 5.15. It looks just like a graph (and it is) but unlike the WWII France graph, it's more skeletal. This is because in some sense, a free tree doesn't contain anything \"extra.\" \nIf you have a free tree, the following interesting facts are true: \n1. There's exactly one path between any two nodes. (Check it!) \n2. If you remove any edge, the graph becomes disconnected.     (Try it!) \n3. If you add any new edge, you end up adding a cycle. (Try it!) \n4. If there are n nodes, there are n - 1 edges. (Think about it!) \nSo basically, if your goal is connecting all the nodes, and you have a free tree, you're all set. Adding anything is redundant, and taking away anything breaks it. \n(^4) There appears to be no consensus as to which of these concepts is the most basic. Some authors refer to a free tree simply as a \"tree\" -- as though this were the \"normal\" kind of tree -- and use the term rooted tree for the other kind. Other authors do the opposite. To avoid confusion, I'll try to always use the full term (although I admit I'm one who considers rooted trees to be the more important, default concept). \n112 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \n C \n B D \n E \n A \n F \n Figure 5.15: A free tree. \nIf this reminds you of Prim's algorithm, it should. Prim's algorithm produced exactly this: a _free tree_ connecting all the nodes -- and specifically the free tree with shortest possible total length. Go back and look at the final frame of Figure 5.14 and convince yourself that the darkened edges form a free tree. \nFor this reason, the algorithm is often called **Prim's minimal spanning tree algorithm**. A \"spanning tree\" just means \"a free tree that spans (connects) all the graph's nodes.\" \nKeep in mind that there are many free trees one can make with the same set of vertices. For instance, if you remove the edge from A to F, and add one from anything else to F, you have a different free tree. \n**Rooted trees** \nNow a **rooted tree** is the same thing as a free tree, except that we elevate one node to become the **root**. It turns out this makes all the difference. Suppose we chose A as the root of Figure 5.15. Then we would have the rooted tree in the left half of Figure 5.16. The A vertex has been positioned at the top, and everything else is flowing under it. I think of it as reaching into the free tree, carefully grasping a node, and then lifting up your hand so the rest of the free tree dangles from there. Had we chosen (say) C as the root \n5.2. TREES 113 \ninstead, we would have a different rooted tree, depicted in the right half of the figure. Both of these rooted trees have all the same edges as the free tree did: B is connected to both A and C, F is connected only to A, _etc._ The only difference is which node is designated the root. \n A \n F B \n C \n D E \n C \n B \n A \n F \n D E \nFigure 5.16: Two different rooted trees with the same vertices and edges. \nUp to now we've said that the spatial positioning on graphs is irrelevant. But this changes a bit with rooted trees. Vertical positioning is our only way of showing which nodes are \"above\" others, and the word \"above\" does indeed have meaning here: it means closer to the root. The altitude of a node shows how many steps it is away from the root. In the right rooted tree, nodes B, D, and E are all one step away from the root (C), while node F is three steps away. \nThe key aspect to rooted trees -- which is both their greatest advantage and greatest limitation -- is that _every node has one and only one path to the root._ This behavior is inherited from free trees: as we noted, every node has only one path to every other. \nTrees have a myriad of applications. Think of the files and folders on your hard drive: at the top is the root of the filesystem (perhaps \"/\" on Linux/Mac or \"C:\\\\\" on Windows) and underneath that are named folders. Each folder can contain files as well as other named folders, and so on down the hierarchy. The result is that each file has one, and only one, distinct path to it from the top of the filesystem. The file can be stored, and later retrieved, in exactly one way. \n114 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \nAn \"org chart\" is like this: the CEO is at the top, then underneath her are the VP's, the Directors, the Managers, and finally the rankand-file employees. So is a military organization: the Commander in Chief directs generals, who command colonels, who command majors, who command captains, who command lieutenants, who command sergeants, who command privates. \nThe human body is even a rooted tree of sorts: it contains skeletal, cardiovascular, digestive, and other systems, each of which is comprised of organs, then tissues, then cells, molecules, and atoms. In fact, anything that has this sort of part-whole containment hierarchy is just asking to be represented as a tree. \nIn computer programming, the applications are too numerous to name. Compilers scan code and build a \"parse tree\" of its underlying meaning. HTML is a way of structuring plain text into a tree-like hierarchy of displayable elements. AI chess programs build trees representing their possible future moves and their opponent's probable responses, in order to \"see many moves ahead\" and evaluate their best options. Object-oriented designs involve \"inheritance hierarchies\" of classes, each one specialized from a specific other. _Etc._ Other than a simple sequence (like an array), trees are probably the most common data structure in all of computer science. \n**Rooted tree terminology** \nRooted trees carry with them a number of terms. I'll use the tree on the left side of Figure 5.16 as an illustration of each: \n**root.** The node at the top of the tree, which is A in our example. Note that unlike trees in the real world, computer science trees have their root at the top and grow down. Every tree has a root except the **empty tree** , which is the \"tree\" that has no nodes at all in it.

Consider, as an example, the outpouring of support for detained immigrants in June 2018, reacting to the Trump administration's controversial family separation policy. As stories and images surfaced, millions of dollars were raised in a matter of days on the premise of pathos, resulting in the temporary suspension of that policy. Your argument wouldn't be complete without an appeal to ethos. Cultivating ethos refers to the means by which you demonstrate your authority or expertise on a topic. You'll have to show your audience that you're trustworthy if they are going to buy your argument. There are a handful of ways to demonstrate ethos: Although your lived experience might not set hard-and-fast rules about the world, it is worth noting that you may be an expert on certain facets of your life. For instance, a student who has played rugby for fifteen years of their life is in many ways an authority on the sport. Professional achievements demonstrate ethos by revealing status in a certain field or discipline. The common expression is \"Stand on the shoulders of giants.\" You can develop ethos by pointing to other people with authority and saying, \"Look, this smart/ experienced/qualified/important person agrees with me.\" A common misconception is that ethos corresponds with \"ethics.\" However, you can remember that ethos is about credibility because it shares a root with \"authority.\" \n#### ETHOS \n##### By personal experience \n##### By education or other certifications \n##### By citing other experts \n 45 COLLECTED WORKS \n \"Good\" argumentation depends largely on your place in time, space, and culture. Different cultures throughout the world value the elements of argumentation differently, and argument has different purposes in different contexts. The content of your argument and your strategies for delivering it will change in every unique rhetorical situation. Continuing from logos, pathos, and ethos, the notion of kairos speaks to this concern. To put it in plain language, kairos is the force that determines what will be the best argumentative approach in the moment in which you're arguing; it is closely aligned with rhetorical occasion. According to rhetoricians, the characteristics of the kairos determine the balance and application of logos, pathos, and ethos. Moreover, your sociohistorical context will bear on what you can assume of your audience. What can you take for granted that your audience knows and believes? The \"common sense\" that your audience relies on is always changing: common sense in the US in 1950 was much different from common sense in the US in 1920 or common sense in the US in 2022. You can make assumptions about your audience's interests, values, and background knowledge, but only with careful consideration of the time and place in which you are arguing. As an example, let's consider the principle of logical noncontradiction. Put simply, this means that for an argument to be valid, its logical premises must not contradict each other: if A = B, then B = A. If I said that a dog is a mammal and a mammal is an animal, but a dog is not an animal, I would be contradicting myself. Or \"No one drives on I-84; there's too much traffic.\" This statement contradicts itself, which makes it humorous to us. However, this principle of noncontradiction is not universal. Our understanding of cause and effect and logical consistency is defined by the millennia of knowledge that has been produced before us, and some cultures value the contradiction rather than perceive it as invalid. This is not to say that either way of seeing the world is more or less accurate but rather to emphasize that your methods of argumentation depend tremendously on sociohistorical context.

A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 48 \n###### CHAPTER 7. \n## SITUATING ARGUMENTS \n###### KRISTY KELLY \n Arguments are all about context, and they're designed for and by people. People have conflicting motivations, complicated views, wide varieties of values, and ideological commitments, and they carry assumptions, both examined and unexamined, that shape their receptivity toward a particular argument. If you are going to persuade anyone, you need to understand as much as you can about those values, motivations, and assumptions before you can get them to listen to you, let alone act based on your argument. Let's look at an example. Let's say you've just moved into an apartment with three new roommates who've already lived together for a year before you moved in. Since you're new to the living situation, you'd want to take some time to understand their preferences, routines, and opinions before you started making changes around the apartment. You certainly wouldn't get a cat before realizing that one of your new roommates has a cat allergy--or if you did, it would be pretty rude. But more subtly than that, you'd need to understand the internal dynamics of the roommate situation before you influence it yourself. Take a smaller example. Maybe your roommates have a friend that comes over frequently but acts really obnoxious in your opinion. They're loud, they leave a mess, and they rely on your roommates to pay for food and drinks without making a contribution themselves. You want to convince your roommates to stop inviting this person over so frequently, and you start the conversation by saying, \"Hey, that one friend of yours is really disruptive and rude every time they come over. Can you stop bringing them here, or at least run it past me before they come over?\" You think you're being reasonable with this request, but one of your roommates gives you a look of shock and says, \"What are you talking about? That person is the best\"; the other roommate goes silent; and the third roommate storms out of the room. You're baffled. Your roommates become awkward around you until you finally pull the first roommate aside and ask, \"What's the deal? Why did everyone react like that?\" You then learn that this friend helped your roommate who stormed out of the room through an incredibly tough time back in high school, to the point that they may never have even made it to college without this friend. The friend then went through some really big struggles themselves and had to start some medications that make their behavior really uneven--causing them to act a little strange when they visit the apartment. You feel a little bit sheepish about your attitude from before, realizing that this all makes a lot of sense now that you know the full context. 49 A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT \nLike we said before: rhetoric is all about **context.** You can't have a decent conversation, let alone persuade someone, if you don't understand the various motivations, connections, and implicit values driving the situation you're stepping into. So that's what a good rhetorician does--they try to understand the internal dynamics of the audience she hopes to influence. You probably understand this on an instinctual level. We use this kind of sensitivity to navigate complicated situations with our friends, families, and coworkers all the time. But you may not have applied this sort of thinking to the writing you've done in academic settings. This book is here to help you situate your arguments in academic conversations, just as you would situate your arguments in social settings where you know all the stakeholders involved. \"So wait--you're saying I have to understand a person's deepest values and moral commitments before I can persuade them? How can I do that if I don't even know the people I'm talking to?\" That may sound like mind reading at best and manipulation at worst. But it's really about respect and ethical argumentation. The best rhetorician listens before she argues. According to Krista Ratcliffe, listening is one of the most important elements of successful communication, particularly when it takes place across cultures or in contexts when the participants might be at odds with one another (196). Actually _listening_ to someone else is hard work. So often we're just looking for ways to shut the other person down or bolster our own viewpoints or we're merely waiting for our turn to speak. But good rhetoric doesn't work that way because it's all about taking the time to understand the audience's values and shape the argument around them rather than merely learning enough about a group of people in order to influence their views. Rhetoricians use the term _presuppositions_ to describe those tacit values that lay the foundations for arguments. Understanding the audience's presuppositions is a prerequisite to effective argumentation. Mark Longaker and Jeffrey Walker call presuppositions \"the system of ideas--the ways of thinking--that the speaker and audience share, making them a community (more or less)\" (14). Presuppositions involve what both the speaker and audience \"love, hate, fear, admire, yearn for; their sense of what is true...what they know as 'fact,' their sense of the structure of reality\"--in other words, the network of beliefs that determines how they see the world (14). Note that the speaker and audience _share_ these values in this definition. It's not enough to pander to your audience, pretending that you believe in something you don't in order to get them to see your way of thinking. This is about arguing from the same playing field so that everyone shares the same rules and sense of what they're aiming for. Here's a classic example: in _A Modest Proposal,_ Jonathan Swift expresses his outrage about the inhumane treatment of impoverished Irish by making a satirical argument for his fellow citizens to enact a program to eat the poor's newborn babies (and worse) to solve the country's economic problems. Swift makes an exaggerated, ironic claim to highlight the folly of his audience's biases and beliefs, and by making his outrageous proposal seem calmly logical, well cited, and persuasive, he beguiles his audience into confronting their own hypocrisy. Not eating babies is one of the audience's latent beliefs about what is right, and Swift uses that shared value to force his audience to see how their _other_ latent beliefs (in this case, tacit acceptance of inhumane treatment of their country's less well-off) are not only wrong but immoral. That's a rather extreme example, but we can see how it applies to the roommate example as well. The roommates share a respect for the history that shapes the visiting friend's behavior, operating on the implicit assumption that it's worth tolerating some of the friend's less-thanideal qualities in recognition of that history. This reveals some of the group's deeper beliefs A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 50 \n about the reciprocal nature of friendship and the importance of mutual support. You likely believe in those ideals, too, but your initial argument wasn't effective because it didn't recognize that those beliefs were in play. For Longaker and Walker, \"Presuppositions determine not only what the speaker means and what the audience understands; they also determine both the speaker's and the audience's understanding of the occasion\" (14). Now that you understand what's really at issue regarding the visiting friend's behavior, you're in a much better position to make arguments that resonate with the presuppositions you all share about friendship. In the quote above, Longaker and Walker say that the speaker and audience become a \"community\" when they're engaging with arguments based on shared beliefs. It turns out that we're all members of beliefs-based communities and that we're shifting between these groups all the time in our day-to-day lives </passage>\n\n<|assistant|>\n", "prediction": "Can you help me extract queries from the following passage <passage> .................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................", "pred_tool_call": null, "true_tool_call": null, "metrics": {"valid_json": false, "name_match": false, "args_exact_match": false, "args_field_precision": 0.0, "args_field_recall": 0.0, "args_field_f1": 0.0}}

Recursion is a way of taking a large problem and breaking it up into similar, but smaller, subproblems. Then, each of those subproblems can be attacked in the same way as you attacked the larger problem: by breaking _them_ up into subproblems. All you need is a rule for eventually stopping the \"breaking up\" process by actually doing something. \nEvery time one of these traversal processes treats a left or right child as a subtree, they are \"recursing\" by re-initiating the whole traversal process on a smaller tree. Pre-order traversal, for instance, \n5.2. TREES 121 \n G \n 8 \n K \n 4 \n D \n 1 \n O \n 2 \n I \n 3 \n M \n 6 \n C \n 5 E \n 7 \n H \n 10 \n A \n 9 B \n 12 \n F \n 11 N \n 14 \n L \n 13 \n Figure 5.20: The order of node visitation in in-order traversal. \nafter visiting the root, says, \"okay, let's pretend we started this whole traversal thing with the smaller tree rooted at my left child. Once that's finished, wake me up so I can similarly start it with my right child.\" Recursion is a very common and useful way to solve certain complex problems, and trees are rife with opportunities. \n**Sizes of binary trees** \nBinary trees can be any ragged old shape, like our Figure 5.17 example. Sometimes, though, we want to talk about binary trees with a more regular shape, that satisfy certain conditions. In particular, we'll talk about three special kinds: \n**full binary tree.** A full binary tree is one in which every node (except the leaves) has two children. Put another way, every node has either two children or none: no stringiness allowed. Figure 5.17 is not full, but it would be if we added the three blank nodes in Figure 5.21. By the way, it isn't always possible to have a full binary tree with a particular number of nodes. For instance, a binary tree with two nodes, can't be full, since it inevitably will have a root with only one child. \n122 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \n G \n K \n D \n O \n I \n M \n C E \n H \n A B \n F N \n L \n Figure 5.21: A full binary tree. \n**complete binary tree.** A complete binary tree is one in which every level has all possible nodes present, except perhaps for the deepest level, which is filled all the way from the left. Figure 5.21 is not complete, but it would be if we fixed it up as in Figure 5.22. \n G \n K \n D \n O \n I \n M \n C E \n H \n A \n L \n B \n F N \n Figure 5.22: A complete binary tree. \n Unlike full binary trees, it is always possible to have a complete binary tree no matter how many nodes it contains. You just keep filling in from left to right, level after level. \n**perfect binary tree.** Our last special type has a rather audacious title, but a \"perfect\" tree is simply one that is exactly bal\n5.2. TREES 123 \n anced: every level is completely filled. Figure 5.22 is not perfect, but it would be if we either added nodes to fill out level 4, or deleted the unfinished part of level 3 (as in Figure 5.23.) \n G \n K \n D \n O \n M \n C E \n H \n A \n I \n B \n F N \n Figure 5.23: A \"perfect\" binary tree. \n Perfect binary trees obviously have the strictest size restrictions. It's only possible, in fact, to have perfect binary trees with 2 h+1^ - 1 nodes, if h is the height of the tree. So there are perfect binary trees with 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, ... nodes, but none in between. In each such tree, 2 h^ of the nodes (almost exactly half) are leaves. \nNow as we'll see, binary trees can possess some pretty amazing powers if the nodes within them are organized in certain ways. Specifically, a binary search tree and a heap are two special kinds of binary trees that conform to specific constraints. In both cases, what makes them so powerful is the rate at which a tree grows as nodes are added to it. \nSuppose we have a perfect binary tree. To make it concrete, let's say it has height 3, which would give it 1+2+4+8=15 nodes, 8 of which are leaves. Now what happens if you increase the height of this tree to 4? If it's still a \"perfect\" tree, you will have added 16 more nodes (all leaves). Thus you have _doubled_ the number of leaves by simply adding one more level. This cascades the more levels you add. A tree of height 5 doubles the number of leaves again (to 32), and height 6 doubles it again (to 64). \n124 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \nIf this doesn't seem amazing to you, it's probably because you don't fully appreciate how quickly this kind of **exponential growth** can accumulate. Suppose you had a perfect binary tree of height 30 -- certainly not an awe-inspiring figure. One could imagine it fitting on a piece of paper...height-wise, that is. But run the numbers and you'll discover that such a tree would have over half a billion leaves, more than one for every person in the United States. Increase the tree's height to a mere 34 -- just 4 additional levels -- and suddenly you have over 8 billion leaves, easily greater than the population of planet Earth. \nThe power of exponential growth is only _fully_ reached when the binary tree is perfect, since a tree with some \"missing\" internal nodes does not carry the maximum capacity that it's capable of. It's got some holes in it. Still, as long as the tree is fairly bushy ( _i.e._ , it's not horribly lopsided in just a few areas) the enormous growth predicted for perfect trees is still approximately the case. \nThe reason this is called \"exponential\" growth is that the quantity we're varying -- the height -- appears as an _exponent_ in the number of leaves, which is 2 h. Every time we add just _one_ level, we _double_ the number of leaves. \nSo the number of leaves (call it l) is 2 h, if h is the height of the tree. Flipping this around, we say that h = lg(l). The function \"lg\" is a logarithm, specifically a logarithm with base-2. This is what computer scientists often use, rather than a base of 10 (which is written \"log\") or a base of e (which is written \"ln\"). Since 2 h grows very, very quickly, it follows that lg(l) grows very, very slowly. After our tree reaches a few million nodes, we can add more and more nodes without growing the height of the tree significantly at all. \nThe takeaway message here is simply that an incredibly large number of nodes can be accommodated in a tree with a very modest height. This makes it possible to, among other things, search a huge amount of information astonishingly quickly...provided the tree's contents are arranged properly. \n5.2. TREES 125 \n**Binary search trees (BST's)** \nOkay, then let's talk about how to arrange those contents. A **binary search tree** (BST) is any binary tree that satisfies one additional property: _every node is \"greater than\" all of the nodes in its left subtree, and \"less than (or equal to)\" all of the nodes in its right subtree._ We'll call this **the BST property**. The phrases \"greater than\" and \"less than\" are in quotes here because their meaning is somewhat flexible, depending on what we're storing in the tree. If we're storing numbers, we'll use numerical order. If we're storing names, we'll use alphabetical order. Whatever it is we're storing, we simply need a way to compare two nodes to determine which one \"goes before\" the other. \nAn example of a BST containing people is given in Figure 5.24. Imagine that each of these nodes contains a good deal of information about a particular person -- an employee record, medical history, account information, what have you. The nodes themselves are indexed by the person's name, and the nodes are organized according to the BST rule. Mitch comes after Ben/Jessica/Jim and before Randi/Owen/Molly/Xander in alphabetical order, and this ordering relationship between parents and children repeats itself all the way down the tree. (Check it!) \nBe careful to observe that the ordering rule applies between a node and the _entire_ contents of its subtrees, not merely to its immediate children. This is a rookie mistake that you want to avoid. Your first inclincation, when glancing at Figure 5.25, below, is to judge it a BST. It is _not_ a binary search tree, however! Jessica is to the left of Mitch, as she should be, and Nancy is to the right of Jessica, as she should be. It seems to check out. But the problem is that Nancy is a descendant of Mitch's _left_ subtree, whereas she must properly be placed somewhere in his _right_ subtree. And yes, this matters. So be sure to check your BST's all the way up and down. \n**The power of BST's** \nAll right, so what's all the buzz about BST's, anyway? The key insight is to realize that if you're looking for a node, all you have to do is start at the root and go _the height of the tree down_ making \n126 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \n Mitch \n Jessica \n Ben Jim \n Randi \n Owen \n Molly \n Xander \n Figure 5.24: A binary search tree. \none comparison at each level. Let's say we're searching Figure 5.24 for Molly. By looking at Mitch (the root), we know right away that Molly must be in the right subtree, not the left, because she comes _after_ Mitch in alphabetical order. So we look at Randi. This time, we find that Molly comes _before_ Randi, so she must be somewhere in Randi's left branch. Owen sends us left again, at which point we find Molly. \nWith a tree this size, it doesn't seem that amazing. But suppose its height were 10. This would mean about 2000 nodes in the tree -- customers, users, friends, whatever. With a BST, you'd only have to examine _ten_ of those 2000 nodes to find whatever you're looking for, whereas if the nodes were just in an ordinary list, you'd have to compare against 1000 or so of them before you stumbled on the one you were looking for. And as the size of the tree grows, this discrepancy grows (much) larger. If you wanted to find a single person's records in New York City, would you rather search 7 million names, or 24 names?? Because that's the difference you're looking at. \nIt seems almost too good to be true. How is such a speedup pos\n5.2. TREES 127 \n Mitch \n Jessica \n Ben Nancy \n Randi \n Owen \n Molly \n Xander \nFigure 5.25: **NOT** a binary search tree, though it looks like one at first glance. (Notice Nancy and Mitch) \nsible? The trick is to realize that with every node you look at, you effectively eliminate _half of the remaining tree_ from consideration. For instance, if we're looking for Molly, we can disregard Mitch's entire left half without even looking at it, then the same for Randi's entire right half. If you discard half of something, then half of the remaining half, then half again, it doesn't take you long before you've eliminated almost every false lead. \nThere's a formal way to describe this speedup, called \"Big-O notation.\" The subtleties are a bit complex, but the basic idea is this. When we say that an algorithm is \"O(n)\" (pronounced \"oh-of-n\"), it means that the time it takes to execute the algorithm is _proportional to the number of nodes._ This doesn't imply any specific number of milliseconds or anything -- that is highly dependent on the type of computer hardware, you have, the programming language, and a myriad of other things. But what we _can_ say about an O(n) algorithm is that if you double the number of nodes, you're going to approximately double the running time. If you quadruple the number of nodes, you're going to quadruple the running time. This is what you'd expect. \n128 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \nSearching for \"Molly\" in a simple unsorted list of names is an O(n) prospect. If there's a thousand nodes in the list, on average you'll find Molly after scanning through 500 of them. (You might get lucky and find Molly at the beginning, but then of course you might get really unlucky and not find her until the end. This averages out to about half the size of the list in the normal case.) If there's a _million_ nodes, however, it'll take you 500,000 traversals on average before finding Molly. Ten times as many nodes means ten times as long to find Molly, and a thousand times as many means a thousand times as long. Bummer. \nLooking up Molly in a BST, however, is an O(lg n) process </passage>\n\n<|assistant|>\n", "prediction": "Can you help me extract queries from the following passage <passage>.

All you need is a rule for eventually stopping the \"breaking up\" process by actually doing something. \nEvery time one of these traversal processes treats a left or right child as a subtree, they are \"recursing\" by re-initiating the whole traversal process on a smaller tree. Pre-order traversal, for instance, \n5.2.
