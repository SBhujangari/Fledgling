For now, just realize that every set is either finite or infinite. \nYou might think, by the way, that there's no way to define an infinite set extensionally, since that would require infinite paper. This isn't true, though, if we creatively use an ellipsis: \n I = { 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 ,... } \nThis is an extensional definition of I, since we're explicitly listing all the members. It could be argued, though, that it's really intensional, since the interpretation of \"... \" requires the reader to \n2.4. SETS ARE NOT ARRAYS 13 \nfigure out the rule and mentally apply it to all remaining numbers. Perhaps in reality we are giving an intensional definition, cloaked in an extensional-looking list of members. I'm on the fence here. \n**2.4 Sets are not arrays** \nIf you've done some computer programming, you might see a resemblance between sets and the collections of items often used in a program: arrays, perhaps, or linked lists. To be sure, there are some similarities. But there are also some very important differences, which must not be overlooked: \n- **No order.** As previously mentioned, there is no order to the     members of a set. \"{Dad, Mom}\" is the same set as \"{Mom,     Dad}\". In a computer program, of course, most arrays or lists     have first, second, and last elements, and an index number     assigned to each. \n- **No duplicates.** Suppose M is the set of all males. What     would it possibly mean to say M = {T.J., T.J., Johnny}?     Would that mean that \"T.J. is twice the man that Johnny     is\"? This is obviously nonsensical. The set M is based on a     property: maleness. Each element of ohm is either male, or it     isn't. It can't be \"male three times.\" Again, in an array or     linked list, you could certainly have more than one copy of     the same item in different positions. \n- **Infinite sets.** 'Nuff said. I've never seen an array with in-     finitely many elements, and neither will you. \n- **Untyped.** Most of the time, an array or other collection in a     computer program contains elements of only a single _type_ : it's     an array of integers, or a linked list of Customer objects, for     example. This is important because the program often needs     to treat all elements in the collection the same way. Perhaps     it needs to loop over the array to add up all the numbers,     or iterate through a customer list and search for customers     who have not placed an order in the last six months. The \n14 CHAPTER 2. SETS \n program would run into problems if it tried to add a string of text to its cumulative total, or encountered a Product object in the middle of its list of Customers. Sets, though, can be heterogeneous , meaning they can contain different kinds of things. The Davies family example had all human beings, but nothing stops me from creating a set X = { Jack Nicholson, Kim Kardashian, Universal Studios, 5786,  }. I don't press this point too hard for a couple of reasons. First, most programming languages do allow heterogeneous collections of some sort, even if they're not the most natural thing to express. In Java, you can define an ArrayList as a nongeneric so that it simply holds items of class \"Object.\" In C, you can have an array of void *'s -- pointers to some unspecified type -- which allows your array to point to different kinds of things. Unless it's a loosely-typed language, though (like Perl or JavaScript), it sort of feels like you're bending over backwards to do this. The other reason I make this distinction lightly is that when we're dealing with sets, we often do find it useful to deal with things of only one type, and so our ohm ends up being homogeneous anyway. \nPerhaps the biggest thing to remember here is that a set is a purely abstract concept, whereas an array is a concrete, tangible, explicit list. When we talk about sets, we're reasoning in general about large conceptual things, whereas when we deal with arrays, we're normally iterating through them for some specific purpose. You can't iterate through a set very easily because (1) there's no order to the members, and (2) there might well be infinitely many of them anyway. \n**2.5 Sets are not ordered pairs (or tuples)** \nYou'll remember from high school algebra the notion of an **ordered pair** (x, y). We dealt with those when we wanted to specify a point to plot on a graph: the first coordinate gave the distance from the origin on the x-axis, and the second coordinate on the y-axis. Clearly an ordered pair is not a set, because as the name implies it is \n2.6. SETS OF SETS 15 \nordered: (3, -4) 6 = (- 4 , 3). For this reason, we'll be very careful to use curly braces to denote sets, and parentheses to denote ordered pairs. \nBy the way, although the word \"coordinate\" is often used to describe the elements of an ordered pair, that's really a geometrycentric word that implies a visual plot of some kind. Normally we won't be plotting elements like that, but we will still have use to deal with ordered pairs. I'll just call the constituent parts \"elements\" to make it more general. \nThree-dimensional points need **ordered triple** s (x, y, z), and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to deduce that we could extend this to any number of elements. The question is what to call them, and you _do_ sort of sound like a rocket scientist (or other generic nerd) when you say **tuple**. (Some people rhyme this word with \"Drupal,\" and others with \"couple,\" by the way, and there seems to be no consensus). If you have an ordered-pair-type thing with 5 elements, therefore, it's a 5-tuple (or a quintuple). If it has 117 elements, it's a 117-tuple, and there's really nothing else to call it. The general term (if we don't know or want to specify how many elements) is **n-tuple**. In any case, it's an ordered sequence of elements that may contain duplicates, so it's very different than a set. \n**2.6 Sets of sets** \nSets are heterogeneous -- a single set can contain four universities, seven integers, and an ahi tuna -- and so it might occur to you that they can contain other _sets_ as well. This is indeed true, but let me issue a stern warning: you can get in deep water very quickly when you start thinking about \"sets of sets.\" In 1901, in fact, the philosopher Bertrand Russell pointed out that this idea can lead to unresolvable contradictions unless you put some constraints on it. What became known as \"Russell's Paradox\" famously goes as follows: consider the set R of all sets that do _not_ have themselves \n16 CHAPTER 2. SETS \nas members^3. Now is R a member of itself, or isn't it? Either way you answer turns out to be wrong (try it!) which means that this whole setup must be flawed at some level. \nThe good news is that as long as you don't deal with this kind of self-referential loop (\"containing yourself as a member\") then it's pretty safe to try at home. Consider this set: \n V = { 3 , 5 , { 5 , 4 }, 2 }. \nThis set has _four_ (not five) members. Three of V 's members are integers: 2, 3, and 5. The other one is a set (with no name given). That other set, by the way, has two members of its own: 4 and 5. If you were asked, \"is 4  V \"? the answer would be _no_. \nAs a corollary to this, there's a difference between \n  \nand {  }. \nThe former is a set with no elements. The latter is a set with _one_ element: and that element just happens to be a set with nothing in it. \n**2.7 Cardinality** \nWhen we talk about the number of elements in a set, we use the word **cardinality**. You'd think we could just call it the \"size\" of the set, but mathematicians sometimes like words that sound cool. The cardinality of M (the set of males, where the Davies family is the domain of discourse) is 3, because there are three elements in it. The cardinality of the empty set  is 0. The cardinality of the set of all integers is . Simple as that. \n(^3) For instance, the set Z of all zebras is a member of R, since Z itself is a set (not a zebra) and so Z / Z. The set S, on the other hand, defined as \"the set of all sets mentioned in this book,\" is _not_ a member of R, since S contains itself as a member. \n2.8. SOME SPECIAL SETS 17 \nThe notation we use for cardinality is vertical bars, like with absolute value. So we write: |M | = 3. \nTo restate the example immediately above, || = 0, but |{}| = 1. \n**2.8 Some special sets** \nIn addition to the empty set, there are symbols for some other common sets, including: \n- Z -- the integers (positive, negative, and zero) \n- N -- the natural numbers (positive integers and zero) \n- Q -- the rational numbers (all numbers that can be expressed     as an integer divided by another integer) \n- R -- the real numbers (all numbers that aren't imaginary,     even decimal numbers that aren't rational) \nThe cardinality of all these sets is infinity, although as I alluded to previously, |R| is in some sense \"greater than\" |N|. For the curious, we say that N is a **countably infinite** set, whereas |R| is **uncountably infinite**. Speaking very loosely, this can be thought of this way: if we start counting up all the natural numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,... , we will never get to the end of them. But _at least we can start counting_. With the real numbers, we can't even get off the ground. Where do you begin? Starting with 0 is fine, but then what's the \"next\" real number? Choosing anything for your second number inevitably skips a lot in between. Once you've digested this, I'll spring another shocking truth on you: |Q| is actually _equal_ to |N|, not greater than it as |R| is. Cantor came up with an ingenious numbering scheme whereby all the rational numbers -- including 3, - 9 , 174 , and - 151729 -- can be listed off regularly, in order, just like the integers can. And so |Q| = |N| 6 = |R|. This kind of stuff can blow your mind. \n18 CHAPTER 2. SETS \n**2.9 Combining sets** \nOkay, so we have sets. Now what can we do with them? When you first learn about numbers back before kindergarten, the next thing you learn is how to combine numbers using various operations to produce other numbers. These include +, -, x, /, exponents, roots, _etc._ Sets, too, have operations that are useful for combining to make other sets. These include: \n- **Union** (). The union of two sets is a set that includes the     elements that _either (or both)_ of them have as members. For     instance, if A = { Dad, Lizzy }, and B = { Lizzy, T.J., Johnny     }, then A  B = { Dad, Lizzy, T.J., Johnny }. Note that an     element is in the union if it is in A _or_ B. For this reason,     there is a strong relationship between the union operator of     sets and the \"or\" () operator of boolean logic that we'll see     later. \n- **Intersection** (). The intersection of two sets is a set that     includes the elements that _both_ of them have as members. In     the above example, A  B = { Lizzy }. There is a strong     connection between intersection and the \"and\" () boolean     logic operator. \n- **(Partial) complement** (-). Looks like subtraction, but sig-     nificantly different. A - B contains _the elements from A that_     _are not also in B_. So you start with A, and then \"subtract off\"     the contents of B, if they occur. In the above example, A - B     = { Dad }. (Note that T.J. and Johnny didn't really enter in     to the calculation.) Unlike  and , - is not **commutative**.     This means it's not symmetrical: A - B doesn't (normally)     give the same answer as B - A. In this example, B - A is     { T.J., Johnny }, whereas if you ever reverse the operands     with union or intersection, you'll always get the same result     as before. \n- **(Total) complement** (X). Same as the partial complement,     above, except that the implied first operand is ohm. In other     words, A-B is \"all the things in A that aren't in B,\" whereas \n2.9. COMBINING SETS 19 \n B is \"all the things period that aren't in B.\" </passage>\n\n<|assistant|>\n", "prediction": "Can you help me extract queries from the following passage <passage>. \n#### EXERCISES \n##### CHAPTER 2.

There are four steps in the proof, and the first three are about showing that B and C have the same number of pivot columns, in the same places. In other words, the \"primed\" symbols are a necessary fiction. First Step. Suppose that d 1 < d' 1. Then 1 = [B] 1 d 1 Definition RREF \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n d 1 k [C]kd 1 \nSSR R E F B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 27 \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n d 1 k(0) d 1 < d' 1 \n = 0 \nThe entries of C are all zero since they are left and below of the leading 1 in row 1 and column d' 1 of C. This is a contradiction, so we know that d 1 >= d' 1. By an entirely similar argument, reversing the roles of B and C, we could conclude that d 1 <= d' 1. Together this means that d 1 = d' 1. Second Step. Suppose that we have determined that d 1 = d' 1 , d 2 = d' 2 , d 3 = d' 3 , \n... dp = d' p. Let us now show that dp+1 = d' p+1. Working towards a contradiction, suppose that dp+1 < d' p+1. For 1 <= ` <= p, \n 0 = [B]p+1,d Definition RREF \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n dp+1,k [C]kd \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n dp+1,k [C]kd'  \n = dp+1, [C]d'  + \n ^ m \n k=1 k 6 = \n dp+1,k [C]kd'  Property CACN \n = dp+1,(1) + \n ^ m \n k k=1 6 = \n dp+1,k(0) Definition RREF \n = dp+1, \nNow, \n 1 = [B]p+1,dp+1 Definition RREF \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n dp+1,k [C]kdp+1 \n = \n ^ p \n k=1 \n dp+1,k [C]kdp+1 + \n ^ m \n k=p+1 \n dp+1,k [C]kdp+1 Property AACN \n = \n ^ p \n k=1 \n (0) [C]kdp+1 + \n ^ m \n k=p+1 \n dp+1,k [C]kdp+1 \n = \n ^ m \n k=p+1 \n dp+1,k [C]kdp+1 \n = \n ^ m \n k=p+1 \n dp+1,k(0) dp+1 < d' p+1 \n = 0 \nThis contradiction shows that dp+1 >= d' p+1. By an entirely similar argument, we could conclude that dp+1 <= d' p+1, and therefore dp+1 = d' p+1. Third Step. Now we establish that r = r'. Suppose that r'^ < r. By the arguments above, we know that d 1 = d' 1 , d 2 = d' 2 , d 3 = d' 3 ,... , dr'^ = d' r'. For 1 <= ` <= r'^ < r, \n 0 = [B]rd Definition RREF \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n drk [C]kd \nSSR R E F B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 28 \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kd + \n ^ m \n k=r'^ +1 \n drk [C]kd Property AACN \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kd + \n ^ m \n k=r'^ +1 \n drk(0) Property AACN \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kd \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kd'  \n = dr [C]d'  + \n ^ r' \n k=1 k 6 = \n drk [C]kd'  Property CACN \n = dr(1) + \n ^ r' \n k=1 k 6 = \n drk(0) Definition RREF \n = dr \nNow examine the entries of row r of B, \n [B]rj = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n drk [C]kj \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kj + \n ^ m \n k=r'^ +1 \n drk [C]kj Property CACN \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kj + \n ^ m \n k=r'^ +1 \n drk(0) Definition RREF \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kj \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n (0) [C]kj \n = 0 \nSo row r is a totally zero row, contradicting that this should be the bottommost nonzero row of B. So r'^ >= r. By an entirely similar argument, reversing the roles of B and C, we would conclude that r'^ <= r and therefore r = r'. Thus, combining the first three steps we can say that D = D'. In other words, B and C have the same pivot columns, in the same locations. Fourth Step. In this final step, we will not argue by contradiction. Our intent is to determine the values of the dij. Notice that we can use the values of the di interchangeably for B and C.

From now on, when we have a matrix in reduced row-echelon form, we will mark the leading 1's with a small box. This will help you count, and identify, the pivot columns. In your work, you can box 'em, circle 'em or write 'em in a different color -- just identify 'em somehow.

Research Should Start with Questions, Not Answers by Emily A.

Although we have not achieved parity in access to technology worldwide, information has never been easier to uncover. This is, of course, a double-edged sword: the proliferation of ideas due to the technological revolution enables new kinds of learning but also has fundamentally changed the way we think and interact. One of my friends refers to his iPhone as the \"Wonder Killer\": because he has such quick access to answers through the miniature computer he carries everywhere, the experience of sustained curiosity is now very rare in his life. All kinds of questions are easily answered by googling \"Who was that guy in Back to the Future Part II ?\" or \"Do spiders hibernate?\" or by taking a brief crawl through Wikipedia: \"How has globalization impacted Bhutan's economy?\" \"What life experiences influenced Frida Kahlo's painting?\" But the answers to these questions, though easily discovered, paint a very one-dimensional portrait of human knowledge. For scientists and writers alike, the spirit of curiosity motivates at once individual learning and also the growth and progress of our collective knowledge. Your innate ability to be curious puts you in the league of the most brilliant and prolific scholars--people who were driven by questions, seeking to interrogate the world around them. In this section, I add my voice to the chorus of writing teachers whose rallying cry is a renewed investment in curiosity. Hopefully, you too will embrace inquisitive fascination by rejecting easy answers and using writing as a means of discovery. It's possible that you've already written research papers by this point in your academic career. If your experience has been like mine, writing these papers went one of two ways: \n**1.** The teacher assigns a specific topic for you to research, and sometimes even a     specific thesis for you to prove. \n**2.** The teacher provides more freedom, allowing students to choose a topic at     their own discretion or from a set of options. \n#### INQUIRY-BASED RESEARCH \n 143 A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT \n In both situations, my teacher expected me to figure out what I wanted to argue, then find research to back me up. I was expected to have a fully formed stance on an issue, then use my sources to explain and support that stance. Not until graduate school did I encounter inquirybased research, which inverts this sequence. Put simply, inquiry-based research refers to research and research writing that is motivated by curiosity rather than a teacher's requirement. A Comparison of Research Styles Table 19.1 A chart comparing inquiry and non-inquiry-based research \n##### Non-inquiry-based research Inquiry-based research \nYour research begins with an answer and seeks out evidence that confirms that answer. Your research begins with a question, reviews all the evidence available, and then develops that answer. For example, a murder occurs, and I get a bad vibe from the butler. I look for all the clues that confirm that the butler did it; assuming I find what I need, I can declare that the butler did it. For example, a murder occurs. I look for as many clues as I can, then determine the most likely culprit based on that evidence. It's quite possible that the butler did do it, and both logical processes might lead me to the same conclusion. However, an inquiry-based investigation allows more consideration for the possibility that the butler is innocent. Consider the difference this can make: if research is about **learning** , then an inquiry-based perspective is essential. If you only seek out the ideas that agree with you, you will never learn. Even in the event that the investigation yields the same answers, their differences are crucial. When we only look for answers that agree with our preexisting ideas, we are more likely to ignore other important ideas, voices, and possibilities. Most importantly, **confirmation bias** inhibits genuine learning, which relies on challenging, expanding, and complicating our current knowledge and world views. Consequently, inquiry-based research is time-consuming and intensive: instead of only dealing with evidence that supports a certain answer or perspective, it requires the reasoner to encounter a great diversity of evidence and answers, which can be difficult to sift through. This distinction has important implications for the kind of research and research writing for which this book advocates.  You don't have to--shouldn't, in fact--have a thesis set in stone before starting your thesis, but you must be tremendously flexible: be prepared to pivot, qualify, nuance, or entirely change your answer as you proceed.  In order to pursue your research question, you will need to encounter _a lot_ of sources. Not all of the sources you encounter will make it into your paper, which is a new practice for some students. This is a time-consuming process, but it leads to more significant learning, more complex thinking, and more interesting and effective rhetoric. A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 144 \n Finding a conversation that you're excited about and genuinely interested in is the first and most important step. As you develop a topic, keep in mind that pursuing your curiosities and passions will make your research process less arduous, more relevant, and more pleasant. Such an approach will also naturally improve the quality of your writing: the interest you have for a topic will come across in the construction of your sentences and your willingness to pursue multiple lines of thought about a topic. An author's boredom results in a boring paper, and an author's enthusiasm translates to enthusiastic writing. Depending on the parameters your teacher has set, your research topic might need to (1) present a specific viewpoint, (2) focus on a specific topic, or (3) focus on a certain theme or set of ideas. It's also possible that your teacher will allow complete autonomy for one or all of your research assignments. Be sure you review any materials your instructor provides and ask clarifying questions to make sure your topic fits the guidelines of their assignment. To generate ideas, identify areas of interest, then develop questions of all sizes and types. Eventually, you will zero in on a question or combination of questions as your path of inquiry. What makes for a good research question or path of inquiry? Of course, the answer to this question will depend on your rhetorical situation. However, there are some common characteristics of a good research question in any situation: Engaging and fruitful research questions require complex, informed answers. However, they shouldn't be so subjective, intricate, or expansive that they simply cannot be answered in the scope of your rhetorical situation. By establishing parameters on your scope, you can be sure your research is directed and relevant. Research questions and the rhetoric they inform are valuable only because they have stakes: even if it's a small demographic, the answers to your research question should impact someone. As discussed earlier in this chapter, inquiry-based research should encourage you to articulate a unique standpoint by synthesizing many different voices, interpreted from your individual perspective, with your life experiences and ideas. What you say doesn't have to be groundbreaking, but it shouldn't just reiterate ideas, arguments, histories, or perspectives. \n#### DEVELOPING A RESEARCH QUESTION \n##### 1. It is answerable but not easily answerable. \n##### 2. It is specific. \n##### 3. It matters to someone. \n##### 4. It allows you to say something new or unique. \n 145 COLLECTED WORKS \n It is difficult to find a question that hits all these marks on your first try. As you proceed through research, prewriting, drafting, and revising, you should refine and adjust your question(s). Just like any other part of writing, developing a path of inquiry is iterative: you've got to take a lot of chances and work your way toward different results. In order to find the best version of your research question, you should develop \"working questions\"--questions of all sizes and types that are pertinent to your subject. As you can see below, you can start with a handful of simple working questions that will eventually lead to a viable research question. Revising Simple Questions into Research Questions Table 19.2 Chart showing the steps of revising a research question from working question to research question \n##### Beginning \n##### interest \n##### Working question \n##### Working research \n##### question \n##### Revised research question \n##### Vietnamese \n##### food and \n##### culture \n What do people eat in Vietnam?

More complex answers, higher stakes, very specific \n##### Health \n Are people in the United States more obese than they used to be? Too straightforward, not specific enough Have obesity rates increased in the United States over the last one hundred years? More specific Is there a correlation between obesity rates and economic instability in the United States over the last one hundred years? More complex answers, higher stakes, very specific \n##### World \n##### religion \n What is the role of religion in the Middle East? Not specific enough, difficult to answer in depth How has religion influenced politics in the Middle East in the last fifty years? More specific, easier to answer How has religion's influence on government impacted the day-to-day lives of Qatari citizens? Very specific, higher stakes, more complex answers As you hone your path of inquiry, you may need to zoom in or out in terms of scope: depending on your rhetorical situation, you will need different degrees of focus. Just like narration, research writing benefits from a careful consideration of scope. Often, a narrower scope is easier to work with than a broader scope--you will be able to write more and write better if your question asks for more complex thinking. It's important to be flexible throughout your research project. Be prepared to pivot topics, adjust your research question, change your opinions, and confront unanticipated challenges. As you build a working knowledge of your topic, you might complicate or narrow your working questions.

This means in order to figure out the value, we have to flip all the bits and add one. Flipping them yields 0101 , and adding one to that gives 0110 (we had to do one carry). Since the binary number 0110 is positive six, that must mean that what we started with - 1010 - must be negative six. \n### Chapter 8 \n## Logic \nTo a great extent, logic governs the way your mind works, even among so-called \"irrational people.\" If we want to capture logical processes and represent them in a computer program, we need a way to express these thoughts in a form suitable for automated reasoning. This is primarily why computer scientists study logic. \nInterestingly, the material in this chapter covers the very bottom and the very top of the technology stack. At the bottom, we have actual physical hardware that consists of circuits turning bits on and off. The rules that govern when we want to turn which bits on and off are based on \"logic gates,\" or tiny physical devices that implement the logical principles of this chapter on a micro scale. At the other end of the spectrum, we have highly abstract programs aiming towards \"artificial intelligence.\" These systems are centered around a \"knowledge base\" of accumulated facts, and regularly examine those known facts to make decisions and draw additional conclusions. What does a knowledge base consist of? You guessed it: logical statements that are described in this chapter. \n**8.1 Propositional logic** \nThe simpler -- but less powerful -- of the two logic systems we'll study is called **propositional logic**. It has this name because the core building block is the **proposition**. A proposition is simply a \n 197 \n198 CHAPTER 8. LOGIC \nstatement that has a \"truth value,\" which means that it is either true or false. The statement \"all plants are living beings\" could be a proposition, as could \"Barack Obama was the first AfricanAmerican President\" and \"Kim Kardashian will play the title role in _Thor: Love and Thunder_ .\" By contrast, questions like \"are you okay?\" cannot be propositions, nor can commands like \"hurry up and answer already!\" or phrases like \"Lynn's newborn schnauzer,\" because they are not statements that can be true or false. (Linguistically speaking, propositions have to be in the indicative mood.) \nWe normally use capital letters (what else?) to denote propositions, like: \n Let A be the proposition that UMW is in Virginia. Let B be the proposition that the King of England is female. Let C be the proposition that dogs are carnivores. \nDon't forget that a proposition doesn't have to be true in order to be a valid proposition (B is still a proposition, for example). It just matters that it is labeled and that it has the potential to be true or false. \nPropositions are considered **atomic**. This means that they are _indivisible_ : to the logic system itself, or to a computer program, they are simply an opaque chunk of truth (or falsity) called \"A\" or whatever. When we humans read the description of A, we realize that it has to do with the location of a particular institution of higher education, and with the state of the union that it might reside (or not reside) in. All this is invisible to an artificially intelligent agent, however, which treats \"A\" as nothing more than a stand-in label for a statement that has no further discernible structure. \nSo things are pretty boring so far. We can define and label propositions, but none of them have any connections to the others. We change that by introducing **logical operators** (also called **logical connectives** ) with which we can build up compound constructions out of multiple propositions. The six connectives we'll learn are: \n8.1. PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC 199 \n  -- \"and\" ! -- \"not\"  -- \"or\" = -- \"implies\" (or \"if... then... \")  -- \"xor\" (exclusive \"or\") = -- \"equiv\" (equivalent) \nJust as the ordinary algebraic operators (+, -, _etc._ ) can be used to join numbers and produce another number, and just as the set operators can be used to join sets and produce another set, the logical operators can be used to join propositions and produce another proposition. The expression \"34 + 59\" produces the number 93. The expression \"{X,Y}{Y,Z}\" produces the set {X,Y,Z}. And the expression \"A  B\" produces the value false, since although UMW is located in Virginia, the King is not female. \nLet's run through the six operators, some of which are intuitive and some of which are not: \n **(\"and\")** The proposition XY is true when both X and Y are true propositions. \"AC\" represents the proposition \"UMW is in Virginia _and_ dogs are carnivores,\" which has a truth value of true since both components are true. This operation is sometimes called a **conjunction**. Notice that the \"\" sign somewhat resembles the \"\" sign for set intersection. This is not an accident. An element is in the intersection of two sets if it is a member of the first _and_ the second set. Hence mathematicians have chosen symbols which reinforce this connection. \n **(\"or\")** The proposition XY is true when either X or Y (or both) are true propositions. \"BC\" represents the proposition \"The King of England is female _or_ dogs are carnivores,\" which has a truth value of true since the second component is true. This operation is sometimes called a **disjunction**. The  looks somewhat like the \"\" sign for set union, since an element is in the union of two sets if it is an element of the first set _or_ the second set (or both). This operator is sometimes called an \"inclusive or\" since it is true if both propositions are true. \n200 CHAPTER 8. LOGIC \n **(\"xor\")** The  operator is just like  except that it's _exclusive_ : the proposition XY is true when _either_ X _or_ Y (but not both) are true propositions. \"BC\" and \"BC\" are both true, but \"AC\" is false, since UMW is in Virginia _and_ dogs are carnivores. \n! **(\"not\")** This operator is different from the others in that it's _unary_ , which means that it only operates on one proposition instead of two. All it does is flip the value from true to false (or vice versa.) The proposition \"A\" is true, but the proposition \"!A\" is false. \"!B,\" on the other hand, is true. This operation is sometimes called a **negation**. \n= **(\"implies\")** Okay, now for the toughest one. We're going to spend significant time thinking through this one carefully, because it's both important (in some ways, the most important of the operators) and also potentially baffling. I've studied this stuff for years, and I still sometimes get stuck when trying to figure out =. \n If we say \"X=Y,\" we're claiming that \" if X is true, then Y is true.\" Note carefully that we are not claiming that X itself is true. We're simply asserting that if it's true, then Y must necessarily also be true. We call the first part of a = proposition the premise , and the second part the conclusion. Here, X is the premise and Y the conclusion. \n So far, it seems easy. It gets a little slippery when you realize that the only claim \"X=Y\" is making is: \" if X is true, then Y must be true\". If X is not true, then \"X=Y\" is making no claim at all. \n Confusingly enough, this means that except for the one scenario where X is true but Y is false, the statement \"X=Y itself\" is always true. So, besides the obviously sensible case when X and Y are both true, X=Y is true even when: (1) X is false and Y is true, and (2) X is false and Y is false. Or, to put it succinctly: X=Y is true whenever either X is false or Y is true or both. \n8.1. PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC 201 \n For example, A=C is a true proposition, believe it or not. In English, it says \"UMW being in Virginia implies that dogs are carnivores.\" The proposition B=A is also true: \"The King of England being female implies that UMW is in Virginia.\" What possible sense can we make out of these nonsensical claims? \n The key to understanding it, for me at least, is twofold. First, remember that to a computer (or a logic system), there is no meaning to the propositions: they're simply atomic building blocks, each of which is true or false. So the fact that to a human, the content of the propositions might have nothing to do with each other -- English Kings and dogs -- is irrelevant to a computer: it just thinks indifferently in terms of \"X\" and \"Y,\" and has no idea what real-world entities any of this refers to. Second, think in terms of ruling out counterexamples. When I assert X=Y, what I'm saying is \"it's impossible for X to be true and Y false, because X's truthfulness would imply Y's truthfulness.\" Just as when I assert XY I'm promising that either X or Y is true (or both), when I assert X=Y I'm promising that either X is false or Y is true (or both). \n In this way, it starts to make sense when someone says, \"Iowa being in the Southern hemisphere implies that Batman's cape is red.\" That assertion is like a promise: \" if it turns out that Iowa is in the Southern hemisphere, then I guarantee Batman's cape is red.\" But since Iowa isn't in the Southern hemisphere, all bets are off. The conclusion was conditional on the premise. \n The reason this operator is so important is that in artificial intelligence, the name of the game is concluding new facts from known existing facts, so that knowledge is increased. Every time a 'bot learns that X=Y is true, and then also learns that the premise (X) is true, it can conclude that the conclusion (Y) is true, even if it was never explicitly told that Y was true. This rule of logic is called modus ponens , and is the workhorse of automated knowledge bases. \n202 CHAPTER 8. LOGIC \n= **(\"equiv\")** Finally, the proposition X=Y is true whenever X and Y have the same value: they're either both true, or both false. This can be seen as \"implies in both directions,\" since X=Y means \"if X is true, then Y is true; and if Y is true, then X is true.\" This operator is also the inverse of , since XY is true only if X and Y are different, and X=Y is true only if they're the same. \nThese operators, which each produce another proposition (called a **compound proposition** ) from the proposition(s) they operate on, can be combined to form complex expressions.

This works out to 256, but we can't actually store the number 256 in a byte if we're using the bit pattern 000000002 (or 0016 ) to represent zero. The highest value would be 111111112 (or FF 16 ), which is 25610. How do we store a number larger than that? Simply use more than one byte, of course. If we used two bytes of memory, and treated them as concatenated one after the other, that would give us 16 bits, allowing us to store up to the number 00000000000000002 = FFFF 16 = 65,535 10. We'd call one of these bytes -- the one representing the 20 's place up to the 27 's place -- the least significant _byte_ , and the other one -- containing places 28 through 215 -- the most significant byte. Extending to more than two bytes to accommodate even larger numbers is done in the obvious way. \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 183 \n**Binary representation schemes** \nThat's mostly all there is to it. But there's one thing we haven't discussed yet, and that's _negative_ numbers. We know how to represent any positive number (or zero) with an ordinary place value scheme. But how do we store a number like - 5? \nThere are three different schemes for treating negative numbers, each with its strengths and weaknesses. \n**Unsigned** \nThe simplest scheme is called **unsigned** , and it simply means that we don't _allow_ negative numbers. For one byte, we have 256 different bit patterns at our disposal, and we might just choose to allocate them all to represent positive numbers, so as to get the widest range. This makes sense for, say, a C++ program variable called heightInInches which we know can never meaningfully be negative (no one has a negative height). \nThe advantage of this scheme is simply that we can represent the greatest possible range of positive numbers, which is sometimes the goal. Each of the alternative schemes carves off a chunk of these available bit patterns and devotes them to representing negative numbers, leaving fewer left over for positive numbers. There's no free lunch: you have to decide how you want to \"spend\" your available bit patterns depending on what values you need to represent. \n**Sign-magnitude** \nThe **sign-magnitude** scheme is probably the first thing you'd think of to solve the negative number representation problem. We need to store the sign of the number somehow, and a sign is inherently a two-valued thing (either positive or negative), so why not peel off one of the bits and use it to represent the sign? The remaining bits can then be used in the ordinary way to represent the magnitude of the number. \nThe way this is most often done is to take the left-most bit and use it as the **sign bit**. This bit now has _no other meaning_. It \n184 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \ncan't \"double\" as the 128's place, because then there'd be no way to distinguish between, say, 129 and - 129 (each would be represented with 10000001 .) No, the sign bit must be considered \"spent money,\" and its expressive power cannot be reclaimed to also represent part of the magnitude. By convention, if the sign bit is 0 this represents a _positive_ number, and a sign bit of 1 represents a _negative_ number. (That might seem counterintuitive, but hey, that's the way it is.) \nSo this number in sign-magnitude: \n 0 0100110 \nrepresents the decimal number 38. That's because the sign bit (bolded, on the far left) is 0, which means the number is positive. The magnitude of the number is contained in the other 7 bits, which gives 32 + 4 + 2 = 38. This number, on the other hand: \n 1 0100110 \nrepresents - 38. The magnitude is the same, but the sign bit is 1 so this pattern now \"means\" a negative number. \nClearly we have reduced our range of positive numbers in exchange for the ability to also store negatives. We have 7 bits of range instead of 8, so instead of 255, our highest possible value is merely \n127. On the other end, the lowest possible value is - 127. \nIf you have sharp eyes, you may have noticed a discrepancy in the counting. With the sign-magnitude approach, we can hold numbers in the range - 127 to 127. But wait: that's only 255 different values, not 256! Why did we lose one value of expressive power? The answer is that the sign-magnitude scheme has _two ways_ of representing _zero_. The bit pattern 00000000 is obviously zero, but so is 10000000 (which you might call \"negative zero.\") Using two different patterns to represent the same value is a little wasteful, but the situation is actually worse than that. Having to account for both patterns means that computer hardware using the signmagnitude scheme is inevitably more complicated. To compare two \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 185 \nbytes to see if they're equal, you'd think we'd just compare each bit position, and if they were all the same, the bytes would be declared equal, otherwise no. Alas, this is no longer quite that simple. The two zero patterns must be considered numerically equal, so our digital logic now has to contain a special case. \"To be equal, all the bits have to be the same... oh, but actually not if the right-most seven are all zeroes in both bytes. In that case, it doesn't matter what the left-most bit contains.\" Maddening. \n**Two's-complement** \nThis shortcoming in the sign-magnitude scheme is remedied with the **two's-complement** scheme, which is the one actually used most often in practice. It'll seem weird at first -- certainly not as intuitive as the first two -- but it leads to a critically important feature that we'll look at shortly. \nFirst, the rules. To interpret a two's-complement number, you: \n1. Look at the left-most bit (just like in sign-magnitude). If     it's a 0, you have a positive number. If it's a 1, you have a     negative number. \n2. If it's a positive number, the other 7 bits give you the mag-     nitude (just like in sign-magnitude). \n3. If, however, it's a negative number, then to discover the mag-     nitude of that negative number you must _flip all the bits and_     _add one_. This will give you a positive number which is the     absolute value of your negative number. \nEasy example: take the byte 00100110. The left-most bit is a 0, which means it's a positive number, and as we discovered above, the remaining 7 bits give a magnitude of 38. So this is the number 38. \nHarder example: take the byte 10100110. The left-most bit is a 1, which means it's negative. Okay: negative _what_? How do we find the magnitude? Well, we \"flip\" all the bits ( _i.e._ , invert each one \n186 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \nfrom 0 to 1 or vice versa) to get: \n 01011001 \nand then add one to the result: \n 1 01011001 + 1 01011010 \nThis black magic produces the value 010110102 , which converts to 9010. **This means that the original number, 10100110 , corresponds to the value -90.** \n\"Flipping all the bits and adding one\" is the cookbook procedure for taking the complement (negative) of a number in the two'scomplement scheme. It works in reverse, too. Let's start with 90 this time and crank through the process again, making sure we get -90. \nStart with the binary representation of 9010 : \n 01011010 \nFlip all the bits to get: 10100101 \nand finally add one to the result: \n 1 10100101 + 1 10100110 \nWe get 10100110 , which was precisely the number we originally began with, and which we have already determined represents -90. \nNow you may ask what we gain from all this. Surely this scheme is considerably more convoluted than the simple idea of reserving one bit as a sign bit, and treating the rest as a magnitude. But it turns out there is indeed a method to the madness. Strange as \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 187 \nit sounds, a two's-complement representation scheme allows us to _perform addition and subtraction with a single operation._ \nIn first grade (or so), you learned the procedure for adding multidigit numbers, which we've followed several times in this chapter. It involves adding the digits right-to-left and possibly \"carrying.\" Then in second grade (or so), you learned the procedure for _subtracting_ multi-digit numbers. It involves subtracting the digits right-to-left and possibly \"borrowing.\" If you're like me, you found adding easier than subtracting. It's easy to just carry the one, but to borrow requires looking at the digit to the left, making sure that you _can_ borrow from it ( _i.e._ , that it's not already 0), borrowing from further left until you actually find an available non-zero value, hoping the number on the bottom is actually less than the one on the top (because otherwise you have to switch the order and then add a negative sign to the result), and keeping all of that straight as you march down the line. \nEven if you didn't find subtracting more difficult than adding, though, you can't argue that it's still a completely _different_ algorithm, with different rules to follow. In computer hardware, we have to implement different circuitry to perform each operation, which is more difficult, costly, error-prone, and power-draining. \nThe wonderful thing about two's-complement, however, is that with this scheme we actually _never need to use the subtraction algorithm._ If we want to subtract two numbers -- say, 24 - 37 -- we can instead take the complement of the second number and then add them. Instead of 24 - 37 we compute 24 + (-37). \nLet's see it in action. Using conversion procedures, we can figure out that 2410 is: \n 00011000 \nand that _positive_ 3710 is: \n 00100101 \nIf we wanted to compute 24 + 37, we'd just add these. But instead we're looking for 24 - 37 , so we'll take the complement of 37 to find \n188 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \n- 37. Flip all the bits of 37: \n 11011010 \nand add one: 1 1011010 + 1 1 1011011 \nand so now we've determined that in the two's-complement scheme, - 37 is represented by 110110112. \nWe're now ready to compute 24 + (-37): \n 1 1 \n00011000 - this is (^2410) + 11011011 - this is - (^3710) 11110011 So we have our two's-complement answer, 11110011. What value does that correspond to? Well, the left-most bit is a 1, so it's a negative number. To find out what it's the negative _of_ , flip all the bits and add one: 0 0001100 - flip the bits to get + 1 - add one 0 0001101 This is positive 13, which means the number we inverted to get it -- 11110011 -- must represent - 13. And that is indeed the correct answer, for 24 - 37 = - 13. One last word on two's-complement: what is the _range_ of numbers we can represent? It turns out to be -128 to 127. The highest value is 01111111 , which is 127. You might think the lowest value would be represented as 11111111 , but if you work it out, you'll find that this is actually the number - 1. The lowest number is actually the bit pattern 10000000 , which is - 128. **Overflow** One last sticky detail we need to cover has to do with **overflow**. When we add two numbers, there is the possibility that the result \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 189 \nwill contain one more digit than the original numbers did. You've probably seen this on a hand calculator when you press \"=\" and get an \"E\" (for \"error\") in the display. If there are only ten digits on your display, adding two ten-digit numbers will (sometimes) result in an eleven-digit number that your calculator can't display, and it's alerting you to that fact so you don't misinterpret the result. Here, we might add two 8-bit quantities and end up with a 9-bit quantity that can't fit in one byte. This situation is called overflow, and we need to detect when it occurs. \nThe rules for detecting overflow are different depending on the scheme. For _unsigned_ numbers, the rule is simple: if a 1 is carried out from the MSB (far left-side), then we have overflow. So if I were to try to add 15510 and 10810 : \n 1 1 1 1 \n10011011 - (^15510) + 01101100 - (^10810) 1 00001111 then I get a carry out left into the 9th digit. Since we can only hold eight digits in our result, we would get a nonsensical </passage>\n\n<|assistant|>\n", "prediction": "Can you help me extract queries from the following passage <passage> 1 00001111 \nwhich is clearly not the correct result. So we have to detect that we have overflow. \nFor _signed_ numbers, the situation is more complicated. We have to consider the sign bit, too. If we're adding two positive numbers and get a result that is too big to fit in our byte, we have to decide what to do. One option is to simply \"wrap around\" to the smallest possible value, which is - 128. This is called **wraparound** or **cyclic** overflow. \nAnother option is to **throw an error**. This is what most calculators do. If you try to add two numbers that are too big, the calculator will alert you to the fact that you have overflow. \nFinally, we have to consider what happens when we're adding two _negative_ numbers. If we get a result that is too big to fit in our byte, we have to decide what to do. One option is to simply \"wrap around\" to the largest possible value, which is 127.

As writers, it is a powerful tool to be able to move back and forth between stylistic modes and communication styles--the better to reach our readers. The following elements of style (in alphabetical order) are just some of the areas where you can make these writerly choices. \n##### Concise Writing \n Concision is the opposite of wordiness. Concise writing is tight and bright; it is clear and content-rich. In other words, it contains no additional fluff or unnecessary words. Why is fluff a problem, at a sentence or paragraph level? Why does this matter, do you think? In the worst cases, wordiness leads to whole paragraphs of fluff and repetition. Sometimes this happens when students are asked to meet a page-length requirement for an assignment. \"How can I possibly write five to six pages about the Endangered Species Act?\" you may wonder. That's a great question and one you could work on with your instructor--but the answer should ultimately boil down to better content, not fluff paragraphs. (A few ideas: add a counterargument, bring in another source, give an example, ask a more complex question, etc.) A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 202 \nIn most writing, though, wordiness happens unconsciously. The kinds of extra words that we add in conversation can make a written sentence confusing and less impactful. Because writing is a more crafted form of communication, we can take the time to edit ourselves and remove the fluff for a stronger final product. Consider the following examples: _Wordy:_ The author of this article, Dr. Belinda Jackson, who is a psychologist and researches cognition, makes the argument that metacognition is very helpful for student learning. _Concise:_ Cognitive psychologist Dr. Belinda Jackson argues that metacognition improves student learning. Notice that the _content_ of the sentence didn't change. Concision is not about simplifying your ideas or removing important details. Instead, the goal is to remove unnecessary words that dilute or confuse the sentence. A more concise sentence is easier to understand and therefore makes a stronger impact. In fact, it leaves room for _more_ content: a concise writer can pack an incredible amount of information and ideas into a paragraph. Conciseness is an ongoing exercise for all writers. Here are a few tips to make your writing more concise:  Remove unnecessary repetition. For example, a \"slow, unhurried, leisurely stroll\" could be rewritten as simply \"a leisurely stroll.\"  Remove empty modifiers--adjectives and adverbs that don't significantly contribute to the meaning of the sentence and are used only to intensify the word they are modifying. The most common ones are _very, really, pretty, totally,_ and _just_.  Use an active voice when it makes sense to do so. More on this in the \"Passive and Active Voice\" section below.  Combine sentences to avoid repetition. For example, this version is wordy: \"I went to the store. The store was Winco. They were closed.\" A more concise version would be \"I went to Winco, but they were closed.\" Notice that concise writing does not always mean short, simple sentences. As Strunk and White put it in their famous book _The Elements of Style_ , That's a high bar but something to aspire to as you work to make your writing concise and content-rich. Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell. (46) 203 COLLECTED WORKS \n##### Correctness \n Many writers feel concerned about \"grammar\" (I used quote marks here because often what they really mean is clarity, syntax, punctuation, or even spelling--any kind of English usage or mechanics). Often, these writers have been told that their writing contains errors or that it's difficult to understand. This can happen for many reasons. Knowledge of mechanics and English usage comes from a combination of the language or dialect you spoke growing up, the way you process language, your exposure to written language, and more. This anxiety can be exacerbated by encounters with \"grammar Nazis\"--people who take it upon themselves to get out their (literal or figurative) red pen and tell you (and the world) exactly what you've done wrong. You may have a grammar stickler in your own life, and the internet is certainly full of them. We've all seen the correction *you're as a saucy retort to haters in the comments section (one of the most satisfying and, it has to be said, pedantic responses out there). The internet itself--and all digital communication--is a great example of how language and English usage are constantly in flux. How often do you see a period at the end of a text message--and if you do, what did you do to make the writer angry? How long has the phrase \"because internet\" been considered a complete thought? Internet linguistics is fascinating in its own right, but I bring it up here as an example of a larger point: grammar is made up. Yes, there are some stylistic and usage choices that make our meaning clearer and more graceful, but some rules are arbitrary and were invented by eighteenthand nineteenth-century grammarians. (\"Never end a sentence with a preposition,\" I'm looking at you--an arbitrary rule if I ever heard one.) There is something to be said for correctness. Errors can distract readers from ideas or make meaning murky, and it is true that others may judge us (again, unfairly) for errors and typos in our emails. (Interestingly, one study suggests that the people most bothered by these kinds of errors are not united by age, education, or time spent reading; instead, their commonality is personality type. Extroverts are more willing to overlook written errors that introverted people may judge negatively [Boland and Queen].) In the field of rhetoric and composition, though, we have moved away from a heavy emphasis on correct usage in the past few years. While there is value in correctness, the most important thing is for your meaning to be clear and your ideas to be sound. Too much focus on where the apostrophe goes can detract from the larger issues of how to build an argument, support a stance, or structure an essay. We need to work on those global aspects of writing before getting down to the nitty-gritty of comma usage. As Stephen Pinker put it, For all the vitriol brought out by matters of correct usage, they are the smallest part of good writing. They pale in importance behind coherence, classic style and overcoming the curse of knowledge, to say nothing of standards of intellectual conscientiousness. If you really want to improve the quality of your writing, or if you want to thunder about sins in the writing of others, the principles you should worry about the most are not the ones that govern fused participles and possessive antecedents but the ones that govern critical thinking and factual diligence. (485) A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 204 \n In other words, grammar and usage are only a small part of the larger writing picture. Your instructor may note patterns of error or point out places where a comma would make your writing clearer--but it will not be the primary focus of most college writing classes. However, when you leave school, it will be up to you to judge the rhetorical situation of any piece of writing and handle correctness accordingly. You already know this subconsciously; just think again about the example of texting a friend versus emailing an instructor. English usage and mechanics are another way to make your writing more effective, powerful, and clear. Think of them as tools to help you strengthen the rhetorical impact of your words and ideas. How can you use these tools to clarify your meaning and help your readers focus on the good stuff? See the \"Additional Resources\" and \"Activities\" sections for more practical and specific guidance on comma usage and more. \n##### Passive And Active Voice \n Maybe this is a familiar phrase: \"Ugh, he's so passive! Why won't he speak up for himself?\" When we describe a person as passive, we mean that they let things happen to them. They don't take action; instead, they allow things to happen without resistance. That definition is helpful when learning about passive voice in writing as well. In passive voice, the object (or recipient) of the action becomes the subject of the sentence. In other words, the focus is on who (or what) received the action rather than on who (or what) completed the action. Here's an example to show you what I mean: Passive: The coffee was drunk by Poppy. Active: Poppy drank the coffee. Both of these sentences are grammatically correct, but as you can see, they have some notable differences. The passive construction is a little longer, and it emphasizes the coffee (the recipient of the action) rather than Poppy (the doer of the action). The active version is more concise, and it focuses on Poppy and her actions. These may seem like small differences, but they add up over the course of a paper. Active voice is often considered sharper, clearer, and cleaner than passive voice. In the example above, you can see why. So why would anyone ever use passive voice? Well, in some cases, the doer of the action is unknown or irrelevant, as in \"The package was delivered this morning\" (passive). We don't know who delivered it, and while the delivery person matters as a human, they don't matter in the meaning of this sentence. In other cases, the receiver of the action is more important than the doer; we emphasize the recipient of the action because that's what matters in the context of the sentence. For example, we almost always say, \"She was born in 1994,\" which is a passive construction. In this situation, who did the action (her mother) is not the most relevant information. If we wrote, \"Her mother gave birth to her in 1994\" (active voice), we would be making a conscious decision to highlight her mother's role in the moment. 205 COLLECTED WORKS \n This is often true in technical and scientific writing as well, which is why the passive voice is more common in STEM fields. In a lab report, for example, the experiment is more important than the researcher; for that reason, it's common to write in the passive voice. For example, \"Hydrochloric acid was then added\" (passive) is more common than \"I added hydrochloric acid.\" We also often use passive voice to avoid blaming others in a negative situation. In some cases, this is considered the most polite route. It may feel accusatory or aggressive to say, \"You did this assignment incorrectly\" (active). Instead, we might say, \"This assignment was done incorrectly.\" Again, both are correct, but we can make a writerly choice here to focus on the receiver of the action (the assignment) and in this case spare someone's feelings. However, be careful! The passive voice is sometimes used in this way to avoid taking responsibility. Newspapers famously use passive voice in a way that emphasizes the victims rather than the criminals. Politicians, corporations, and regular people also use the passive voice to duck blame or responsibility. Consider the following examples: Passive: She was assaulted at a party. Active: An unknown male assaulted her at a party. Passive: Authors of color have been historically marginalized by the publishing industry. Active: Historically, the publishing industry marginalized authors of color. Passive: Mistakes were made. Active: We made a mistake. (Or even more unthinkable: I made a mistake.) How does the active voice shift the focus of the sentence and potentially the cultural framing of sexual assault, racism, and other errors? You can see how the use of active or passive voice can be a political choice as well as a stylistic one. Passive voice isn't grammatically incorrect, and it has its place. The key (as with all elements of style) is to consider how its use impacts your writing. Notice it and make a choice about when to use it and when to cut it. You can check your own writing for passive voice. Does the \"doer\" of the action come after the action (the thing that was done)? Or does the doer disappear completely? If so, the sentence is likely in a passive voice. You can also look for this construction in your sentences: \n##### Point Of View: To \"I\" Or Not To \"I\" \n As a general rule, an \"I\" voice will give your writing a more personal and subjective feel. That's why a first-person perspective is common in memoirs and personal essays but rarely seen in STEM fields (although some scientific articles do refer to the researchers as \"we,\" which is a personal pronoun but somehow slightly less intimate than \"I\"). Academic writing in the humanities and social sciences is somewhere in between these two extremes--depending on the subject and context, a writer can make their own choice. Many well-known scholars in these fields use an \"I\" in their academic papers, especially if their connection to the subject \n### \"TO BE\" VERB (IS, ARE, WAS, ETC.) + \n### PAST PARTICIPLE (WALKED, TAKEN, \n### SEEN, ETC.) = PASSIVE VOICE \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 206 \n is important to understanding their perspective or point. Some authors use it just a little bit--maybe they open their article with a personal anecdote before moving into a more objective tone--while others use it throughout a piece of writing. It's worth noting that although writing without the \"I\" can be read as more objective, all writing is created by people with perspectives and stances. If I make an argument, it doesn't matter if I frame it with \"I argue\" or not; it's still my argument. From one perspective, then, using an \"I\" voice is simply more transparent about the subjectivity of the work. The \"I\" voice is slightly less formal, although it can still have a place in academic writing. It can also feel quite personal, depending on the subject.

(Step 1) Now compute 1838 mod 16. This gives us the value     14, which is of course a base 10 number. The equivalent hex     digit is E. So we now write down E to the left of the 3: \nE3 \n4. (Step 2) Dividing 1838 by 16 and taking the floor gives us \n114. Since this is again not zero, we perform step 2b: make 114 our new value, move our pencil to the left of the E, and go back to step 1. \n5. (Step 1) Next we compute 114 mod 16. This turns out to be     2, so we write down a 2: \n2E3 \n176 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \n6. (Step 2) Computing  114 / 16  produces 7, which is again not     zero, so 7 becomes our new value and we go back once again     to step 2b. \n7. (Step 1) 7 mod 16 is simply 7, so we write it down: \n72E3 \n8. (Step 2) Finally,  7 / 16  is zero, so we go to step 2a and     we're done. The page has 72E3 written on it in big bold     letters, which is the correct answer. \n**Adding hex numbers** \nSuppose we have two hexadecimal numbers, and we want to add them together to get a hexadecimal result. How do we do it? One way is to first convert them both to decimal, then add them like you learned in first grade, then convert the answer back to hex. But we can stay \"natively hex\" as long as we add each pair of digits correctly. \nLet's try it. Suppose we want to compute this sum: \n48 D (^416) +59 2 5 16 ? 16 We proceed in the first-grade way from right to left. Adding the one's-place values, we get 4 + 5 = 9: 48 D (^416) +59 2 5 16 (^916) Easy enough. Now we add the next digit to the left (the sixteen'splace, mind you, not the ten's place) and we find D + 2. Now what in the world is \"D+2\"? It's actually easy: all you have to do is the same thing you did when you were a child and you had to add something like 4 + 5. You hadn't memorized the answer \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 177 \nyet, and so you started with four fingers held up, and counted off \"1... 2... 3... 4... 5,\" sticking up another finger each time. Then, you looked at your hands, and behold! nine fingers. \nWe'll do the same thing here: start with the number \"D,\" and count two additional places: \"E... F.\" The answer is F. That is the number that's two greater than D. Lucky for us, it still fits in one digit. So now we have: \n48 D (^416) +59 2 5 16 F (^916) So far so good. The next pair of digits is 8 + 9. Here's where you want to be careful. You're liable to look at \"8+9\" and immediately say \"17!\" But 8 + 9 is _not_ 17 in hexadecimal. To figure out what it is, we start with the number 8, and count: \"9... A... B... C... D... E... F... 10... 11... \". The answer is \"11,\" which of course is how you write \"seventeen\" in hex. So just like in grade school, we write down 1 and carry the 1: 1 48 D (^416) +59 2 5 16 1 F (^916) Finally, our last digit is 4 + 5, plus the carried 1. We start with four and count off five: \"5... 6... 7... 8... 9.\" Then we add the carry, and count \"... A.\" The answer is A, with no carry, and so we have our final answer: 1 4 8D (^416) + 5 9 2 5 16 **A1F9 16 7.4 Binary (base 2)** The other base we commonly use in computer science is base 2, or **binary**. This is because the basic unit of information in a computer is called a **bit** , which has only two values, conventionally called either \"true\" and \"false\" or \"1\" and \"0\". Numbers (as well \n178 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \nas everything else) are ultimately represented as colossal sequences of 1's and 0's, which are of course binary numbers. \nThe rules for interpreting place value are the same: \n 1101012 = 1 x 25 + 1 x 24 + 0 x 23 + 1 x 22 + 0 x 21 + 1 x 20 = 1 x 32 + 1 x 16 + 0 x 8 + 1 x 4 + 0 x 2 + 1 x 1 = 5310. \nSo in binary we have a one's-place, a two's-place, a four's-place, an eight's-place, and so on. We call the right-most place the **least significant bit (LSB)** and the left-most the **most significant bit (MSB)**. \nCounting up from zero is really just the same as any other base, although it feels a little strange in binary because you \"roll over\" so often: \n 02 zero 12 one 102 two 112 three 1002 four 1012 five 1102 six 1112 seven 10002 eight 10012 nine .. . \n .. . \n**Converting to and from decimal** \nConverting from binary to decimal was demonstrated above (with 1101012 = 53 10 .) To go the other way, we follow the algorithm from page 174. Let's try it for the decimal number 49: \n1. (Step 1) We first compute 49 mod 2. Doing \"mod 2\" is easy:     you just see whether the number is even or odd. In this case,     it's odd, so the remainder is a 1: \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 179 \n1 \n2. (Step 2) Now divide 49 by 2 and take the floor, which gives      49 / 2  = 24. It's not zero, so we perform step 2b: make 24     our new value, move our pencil to the left of the 1, and go     back to step 1. \n3. (Step 1) Compute 24 mod 2. Since 24 is even, this is zero,     which we write down to the left of the 1: \n01 \n4. (Step 2) Divide 24 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  24 /     2  = 12. Make 12 our new value, move our pencil to the left     of the 0, and go back to step 1. \n5. (Step 1) Compute 12 mod 2. Since 12 is even, this is zero,     which we write down: \n001 \n6. (Step 2) Divide 12 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  12 /     2  = 6. Make 6 our new value, move our pencil to the left of     the 0, and go back to step 1. \n7. (Step 1) Compute 6 mod 2. Since 6 is even, this is zero, which     we write down: \n0001 \n8. (Step 2) Divide 6 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  6 / 2  =     3. Make 3 our new value, move our pencil to the left of the     0, and go back to step 1. \n9. (Step 1) Compute 3 mod 2. Since 3 is odd, this is one, which     we write down: \n180 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \n10001 \n10. (Step 2) Divide 3 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  3 / 2  =     1. This still isn't zero, so make 1 our new value, move our     pencil to the left of the 0, and go back to step 1. \n11. (Step 1) Compute 1 mod 2. Since 1 is odd, this is one, which     we write down: \n110001 \n12. (Step 2) Divide 1 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  1 / 2  =     0. We're done. The final answer is 1100012. Double-checking     our work, we verify that indeed one 32 plus one 16 plus one     1 gives 49, which is what we started with. \n**Converting to and from hex** \nThat was pretty tedious. But converting back and forth from binary to _hex_ is a snap. That's because 16 is exactly 24 , and so one hex digit is exactly equal to four binary digits. This isn't the case with base 10, where one decimal digit is equal to three binary digits... _plus_ a little extra. This \"not quite a whole number of digits\" thing is what makes converting from decimal to binary (or decimal to hex, for that matter) so awkward. \nWe most commonly deal with sets of eight bits at a time, which is called a **byte**. (This is the fundamental unit of storage on pretty much every computer on earth.) Suppose I had the following byte: \n(^100001102) Because one hex digit is exactly equal to four bits, this byte is exactly equal to: (^8616) \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 181 \nThis is because the byte can be neatly split into two parts: 1000 , which corresponds to the hex digit 8, and 0110, which corresponds to the hex digit 6. These two halves are called **nibbles** -- one byte has two nibbles, and each nibble is one hex digit. At a glance, therefore, with no multiplying or adding, we can convert from binary to hex. \nGoing the other direction is just as easy. If we have: \n 3E 16 \nwe just convert each hex digit into the corresponding nibble: \n(^001111102) After you do this a while, you get to the point where you can instantly recognize which hex digit goes with which nibble value. Until then, though, here's a handy table: nibble hex digit 0000 0 0001 1 0010 2 0011 3 0100 4 0101 5 0110 6 0111 7 1000 8 1001 9 1010 A 1011 B 1100 C 1101 D 1110 E 1111 F In case you're wondering, yes this is worth memorizing. \n182 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \n**Adding binary numbers** \nAdding two binary numbers is the same as adding in decimal, hexadecimal, or any other base: you just have to know when to \"roll over the odometer,\" which in this case is almost instantly, since the highest value a bit can hold is 1! Let's give it a shot: \n(^1110012) + (^0110102) ? 2 A child could follow the rules: when we add two zeroes, we get zero. Adding a one to a zero gives one. Adding two ones gives zero, and a carry to the next significant digit. And adding two ones plus a carry gives a one and a carry. See if you can follow the flow: 1 1 (^1110012) + (^0110102) 1 010011 2 **Capacity** How large a value can a byte store? There are 8 bits, and each one can independently have either of two values (0 or 1), so by the Fundamental Theorem of Counting, there are 28 different combinations. This works out to 256, but we can't actually store the number 256 in a byte if we're using the bit pattern 000000002 (or 0016 ) to represent zero. The highest value would be 111111112 (or FF 16 ), which is 25610. How do we store a number larger than that? Simply use more than one byte, of course. If we used two bytes of memory, and treated them as concatenated one after the other, that would give us 16 bits, allowing us to store up to the number 00000000000000002 = FFFF 16 = 65,535 10. We'd call one of these bytes -- the one representing the 20 's place up to the 27 's place -- the least significant _byte_ , and the other one -- containing places 28 through 215 -- the most significant byte. Extending to more than two bytes to accommodate even larger numbers is done in the obvious way. \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 183 \n**Binary representation schemes** \nThat's mostly all there is to it. But there's one thing we haven't discussed yet, and that's _negative_ numbers. We know how to represent any positive number (or zero) with an ordinary place value scheme.

This gives us the value     14, which is of course a base 10 number. The equivalent hex     digit is E. So we now write down E to the left of the 3: \nE3 \n4. (Step 2) Dividing 1838 by 16 and taking the floor gives us \n114.
