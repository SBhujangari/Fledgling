For now, just realize that every set is either finite or infinite. \nYou might think, by the way, that there's no way to define an infinite set extensionally, since that would require infinite paper. This isn't true, though, if we creatively use an ellipsis: \n I = { 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 ,... } \nThis is an extensional definition of I, since we're explicitly listing all the members. It could be argued, though, that it's really intensional, since the interpretation of \"... \" requires the reader to \n2.4. SETS ARE NOT ARRAYS 13 \nfigure out the rule and mentally apply it to all remaining numbers. Perhaps in reality we are giving an intensional definition, cloaked in an extensional-looking list of members. I'm on the fence here. \n**2.4 Sets are not arrays** \nIf you've done some computer programming, you might see a resemblance between sets and the collections of items often used in a program: arrays, perhaps, or linked lists. To be sure, there are some similarities. But there are also some very important differences, which must not be overlooked: \n- **No order.** As previously mentioned, there is no order to the     members of a set. \"{Dad, Mom}\" is the same set as \"{Mom,     Dad}\". In a computer program, of course, most arrays or lists     have first, second, and last elements, and an index number     assigned to each. \n- **No duplicates.** Suppose M is the set of all males. What     would it possibly mean to say M = {T.J., T.J., Johnny}?     Would that mean that \"T.J. is twice the man that Johnny     is\"? This is obviously nonsensical. The set M is based on a     property: maleness. Each element of ohm is either male, or it     isn't. It can't be \"male three times.\" Again, in an array or     linked list, you could certainly have more than one copy of     the same item in different positions. \n- **Infinite sets.** 'Nuff said. I've never seen an array with in-     finitely many elements, and neither will you. \n- **Untyped.** Most of the time, an array or other collection in a     computer program contains elements of only a single _type_ : it's     an array of integers, or a linked list of Customer objects, for     example. This is important because the program often needs     to treat all elements in the collection the same way. Perhaps     it needs to loop over the array to add up all the numbers,     or iterate through a customer list and search for customers     who have not placed an order in the last six months. The \n14 CHAPTER 2. SETS \n program would run into problems if it tried to add a string of text to its cumulative total, or encountered a Product object in the middle of its list of Customers. Sets, though, can be heterogeneous , meaning they can contain different kinds of things. The Davies family example had all human beings, but nothing stops me from creating a set X = { Jack Nicholson, Kim Kardashian, Universal Studios, 5786,  }. I don't press this point too hard for a couple of reasons. First, most programming languages do allow heterogeneous collections of some sort, even if they're not the most natural thing to express. In Java, you can define an ArrayList as a nongeneric so that it simply holds items of class \"Object.\" In C, you can have an array of void *'s -- pointers to some unspecified type -- which allows your array to point to different kinds of things. Unless it's a loosely-typed language, though (like Perl or JavaScript), it sort of feels like you're bending over backwards to do this. The other reason I make this distinction lightly is that when we're dealing with sets, we often do find it useful to deal with things of only one type, and so our ohm ends up being homogeneous anyway. \nPerhaps the biggest thing to remember here is that a set is a purely abstract concept, whereas an array is a concrete, tangible, explicit list. When we talk about sets, we're reasoning in general about large conceptual things, whereas when we deal with arrays, we're normally iterating through them for some specific purpose. You can't iterate through a set very easily because (1) there's no order to the members, and (2) there might well be infinitely many of them anyway. \n**2.5 Sets are not ordered pairs (or tuples)** \nYou'll remember from high school algebra the notion of an **ordered pair** (x, y). We dealt with those when we wanted to specify a point to plot on a graph: the first coordinate gave the distance from the origin on the x-axis, and the second coordinate on the y-axis. Clearly an ordered pair is not a set, because as the name implies it is \n2.6. SETS OF SETS 15 \nordered: (3, -4) 6 = (- 4 , 3). For this reason, we'll be very careful to use curly braces to denote sets, and parentheses to denote ordered pairs. \nBy the way, although the word \"coordinate\" is often used to describe the elements of an ordered pair, that's really a geometrycentric word that implies a visual plot of some kind. Normally we won't be plotting elements like that, but we will still have use to deal with ordered pairs. I'll just call the constituent parts \"elements\" to make it more general. \nThree-dimensional points need **ordered triple** s (x, y, z), and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to deduce that we could extend this to any number of elements. The question is what to call them, and you _do_ sort of sound like a rocket scientist (or other generic nerd) when you say **tuple**. (Some people rhyme this word with \"Drupal,\" and others with \"couple,\" by the way, and there seems to be no consensus). If you have an ordered-pair-type thing with 5 elements, therefore, it's a 5-tuple (or a quintuple). If it has 117 elements, it's a 117-tuple, and there's really nothing else to call it. The general term (if we don't know or want to specify how many elements) is **n-tuple**. In any case, it's an ordered sequence of elements that may contain duplicates, so it's very different than a set. \n**2.6 Sets of sets** \nSets are heterogeneous -- a single set can contain four universities, seven integers, and an ahi tuna -- and so it might occur to you that they can contain other _sets_ as well. This is indeed true, but let me issue a stern warning: you can get in deep water very quickly when you start thinking about \"sets of sets.\" In 1901, in fact, the philosopher Bertrand Russell pointed out that this idea can lead to unresolvable contradictions unless you put some constraints on it. What became known as \"Russell's Paradox\" famously goes as follows: consider the set R of all sets that do _not_ have themselves \n16 CHAPTER 2. SETS \nas members^3. Now is R a member of itself, or isn't it? Either way you answer turns out to be wrong (try it!) which means that this whole setup must be flawed at some level. \nThe good news is that as long as you don't deal with this kind of self-referential loop (\"containing yourself as a member\") then it's pretty safe to try at home. Consider this set: \n V = { 3 , 5 , { 5 , 4 }, 2 }. \nThis set has _four_ (not five) members. Three of V 's members are integers: 2, 3, and 5. The other one is a set (with no name given). That other set, by the way, has two members of its own: 4 and 5. If you were asked, \"is 4  V \"? the answer would be _no_. \nAs a corollary to this, there's a difference between \n  \nand {  }. \nThe former is a set with no elements. The latter is a set with _one_ element: and that element just happens to be a set with nothing in it. \n**2.7 Cardinality** \nWhen we talk about the number of elements in a set, we use the word **cardinality**. You'd think we could just call it the \"size\" of the set, but mathematicians sometimes like words that sound cool. The cardinality of M (the set of males, where the Davies family is the domain of discourse) is 3, because there are three elements in it. The cardinality of the empty set  is 0. The cardinality of the set of all integers is . Simple as that. \n(^3) For instance, the set Z of all zebras is a member of R, since Z itself is a set (not a zebra) and so Z / Z. The set S, on the other hand, defined as \"the set of all sets mentioned in this book,\" is _not_ a member of R, since S contains itself as a member. \n2.8. SOME SPECIAL SETS 17 \nThe notation we use for cardinality is vertical bars, like with absolute value. So we write: |M | = 3. \nTo restate the example immediately above, || = 0, but |{}| = 1. \n**2.8 Some special sets** \nIn addition to the empty set, there are symbols for some other common sets, including: \n- Z -- the integers (positive, negative, and zero) \n- N -- the natural numbers (positive integers and zero) \n- Q -- the rational numbers (all numbers that can be expressed     as an integer divided by another integer) \n- R -- the real numbers (all numbers that aren't imaginary,     even decimal numbers that aren't rational) \nThe cardinality of all these sets is infinity, although as I alluded to previously, |R| is in some sense \"greater than\" |N|. For the curious, we say that N is a **countably infinite** set, whereas |R| is **uncountably infinite**. Speaking very loosely, this can be thought of this way: if we start counting up all the natural numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,... , we will never get to the end of them. But _at least we can start counting_. With the real numbers, we can't even get off the ground. Where do you begin? Starting with 0 is fine, but then what's the \"next\" real number? Choosing anything for your second number inevitably skips a lot in between. Once you've digested this, I'll spring another shocking truth on you: |Q| is actually _equal_ to |N|, not greater than it as |R| is. Cantor came up with an ingenious numbering scheme whereby all the rational numbers -- including 3, - 9 , 174 , and - 151729 -- can be listed off regularly, in order, just like the integers can. And so |Q| = |N| 6 = |R|. This kind of stuff can blow your mind. \n18 CHAPTER 2. SETS \n**2.9 Combining sets** \nOkay, so we have sets. Now what can we do with them? When you first learn about numbers back before kindergarten, the next thing you learn is how to combine numbers using various operations to produce other numbers. These include +, -, x, /, exponents, roots, _etc._ Sets, too, have operations that are useful for combining to make other sets. These include: \n- **Union** (). The union of two sets is a set that includes the     elements that _either (or both)_ of them have as members. For     instance, if A = { Dad, Lizzy }, and B = { Lizzy, T.J., Johnny     }, then A  B = { Dad, Lizzy, T.J., Johnny }. Note that an     element is in the union if it is in A _or_ B. For this reason,     there is a strong relationship between the union operator of     sets and the \"or\" () operator of boolean logic that we'll see     later. \n- **Intersection** (). The intersection of two sets is a set that     includes the elements that _both_ of them have as members. In     the above example, A  B = { Lizzy }. There is a strong     connection between intersection and the \"and\" () boolean     logic operator. \n- **(Partial) complement** (-). Looks like subtraction, but sig-     nificantly different. A - B contains _the elements from A that_     _are not also in B_. So you start with A, and then \"subtract off\"     the contents of B, if they occur. In the above example, A - B     = { Dad }. (Note that T.J. and Johnny didn't really enter in     to the calculation.) Unlike  and , - is not **commutative**.     This means it's not symmetrical: A - B doesn't (normally)     give the same answer as B - A. In this example, B - A is     { T.J., Johnny }, whereas if you ever reverse the operands     with union or intersection, you'll always get the same result     as before. \n- **(Total) complement** (X). Same as the partial complement,     above, except that the implied first operand is ohm. In other     words, A-B is \"all the things in A that aren't in B,\" whereas \n2.9.

There are four steps in the proof, and the first three are about showing that B and C have the same number of pivot columns, in the same places. In other words, the \"primed\" symbols are a necessary fiction. First Step. Suppose that d 1 < d' 1. Then 1 = [B] 1 d 1 Definition RREF \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n d 1 k [C]kd 1 \nSSR R E F B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 27 \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n d 1 k(0) d 1 < d' 1 \n = 0 \nThe entries of C are all zero since they are left and below of the leading 1 in row 1 and column d' 1 of C. This is a contradiction, so we know that d 1 >= d' 1. By an entirely similar argument, reversing the roles of B and C, we could conclude that d 1 <= d' 1. Together this means that d 1 = d' 1. Second Step. Suppose that we have determined that d 1 = d' 1 , d 2 = d' 2 , d 3 = d' 3 , \n... dp = d' p. Let us now show that dp+1 = d' p+1. Working towards a contradiction, suppose that dp+1 < d' p+1. For 1 <= ` <= p, \n 0 = [B]p+1,d Definition RREF \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n dp+1,k [C]kd \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n dp+1,k [C]kd'  \n = dp+1, [C]d'  + \n ^ m \n k=1 k 6 = \n dp+1,k [C]kd'  Property CACN \n = dp+1,(1) + \n ^ m \n k k=1 6 = \n dp+1,k(0) Definition RREF \n = dp+1, \nNow, \n 1 = [B]p+1,dp+1 Definition RREF \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n dp+1,k [C]kdp+1 \n = \n ^ p \n k=1 \n dp+1,k [C]kdp+1 + \n ^ m \n k=p+1 \n dp+1,k [C]kdp+1 Property AACN \n = \n ^ p \n k=1 \n (0) [C]kdp+1 + \n ^ m \n k=p+1 \n dp+1,k [C]kdp+1 \n = \n ^ m \n k=p+1 \n dp+1,k [C]kdp+1 \n = \n ^ m \n k=p+1 \n dp+1,k(0) dp+1 < d' p+1 \n = 0 \nThis contradiction shows that dp+1 >= d' p+1. By an entirely similar argument, we could conclude that dp+1 <= d' p+1, and therefore dp+1 = d' p+1. Third Step. Now we establish that r = r'. Suppose that r'^ < r. By the arguments above, we know that d 1 = d' 1 , d 2 = d' 2 , d 3 = d' 3 ,... , dr'^ = d' r'. For 1 <= ` <= r'^ < r, \n 0 = [B]rd Definition RREF \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n drk [C]kd \nSSR R E F B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 28 \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kd + \n ^ m \n k=r'^ +1 \n drk [C]kd Property AACN \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kd + \n ^ m \n k=r'^ +1 \n drk(0) Property AACN \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kd \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kd'  \n = dr [C]d'  + \n ^ r' \n k=1 k 6 = \n drk [C]kd'  Property CACN \n = dr(1) + \n ^ r' \n k=1 k 6 = \n drk(0) Definition RREF \n = dr \nNow examine the entries of row r of B, \n [B]rj = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n drk [C]kj \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kj + \n ^ m \n k=r'^ +1 \n drk [C]kj Property CACN \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kj + \n ^ m \n k=r'^ +1 \n drk(0) Definition RREF \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kj \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n (0) [C]kj \n = 0 \nSo row r is a totally zero row, contradicting that this should be the bottommost nonzero row of B. So r'^ >= r. By an entirely similar argument, reversing the roles of B and C, we would conclude that r'^ <= r and therefore r = r'. Thus, combining the first three steps we can say that D = D'. In other words, B and C have the same pivot columns, in the same locations. Fourth Step. In this final step, we will not argue by contradiction. Our intent is to determine the values of the dij. Notice that we can use the values of the di interchangeably for B and C. Here we go, \n 1 = [B]idi Definition RREF \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n dik [C]kdi \n = dii [C]idi + \n ^ m \n k=1 k 6 =i \n dik [C]kdi Property CACN \nSSR R E F B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 29 \n = dii(1) + \n ^ m \n k=1 k 6 =i \n dik(0) Definition RREF \n = dii \nand for ` 6 = i \n 0 = [B]id Definition RREF \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n dik [C]kd \n = di [C]d + \n ^ m \n k=1 k 6 = \n dik [C]kd Property CACN \n = di(1) + \n ^ m \n k=1 k 6 = \n dik(0) Definition RREF \n = di \nFinally, having determined the values of the dij , we can show that B = C. For 1 <= i <= m, 1 <= j <= n, \n [B]ij = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n dik [C]kj \n = dii [C]ij + \n ^ m \n k=1 k 6 =i \n dik [C]kj Property CACN \n = (1) [C]ij + \n ^ m \n k k=1 6 =i \n (0) [C]kj \n = [C]ij \nSo B and C have equal values in every entry, and so are the same matrix. \u0004 \nWe will now run through some examples of using these definitions and theorems to solve some systems of equations. From now on, when we have a matrix in reduced row-echelon form, we will mark the leading 1's with a small box. This will help you count, and identify, the pivot columns. In your work, you can box 'em, circle 'em or write 'em in a different color -- just identify 'em somehow. This device will prove very useful later and is a very good habit to start developing right now. \nExample SAB Solutions for Archetype B Let us find the solutions to the following system of equations, \n - 7 x 1 - 6 x 2 - 12 x 3 = - 33 5 x 1 + 5x 2 + 7x 3 = 24 x 1 + 4x 3 = 5 First, form the augmented matrix, [- 7 - 6 - 12 - 33 5 5 7 24 1 0 4 5 \n ] \nand work to reduced row-echelon form, first with j = 1, \n R 1 -R 3 ------ \n [ 1 0 4 5 5 5 7 24 - 7 - 6 - 12 - 33 \n ] - 5 R 1 +R 2 ------- \n [ 1 0 4 5 0 5 - 13 - 1 - 7 - 6 - 12 - 33 \n ] \nSSR R E F B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 30 \n -^7 -R-^1 +--R-^3 \n   \n 1 0 4 5 0 5 - 13 - 1 0 - 6 16 2 \n   \nNow, with j = 2, \n(^15) R 2 ----   1 0 4 5 0 1 - 513 - 51 0 - 6 16 2   (^) -^6 -R-^2 -+-R-^3   1 0 4 5 0 1 - 513 - 51 (^0 0 2545)   And finally, with j = 3, (^52) R 3 ----   1 0 4 5 0 1 - 513 - 51 0 0 1 2   (^135) R 3 +R 2 -------   1 0 4 5 0 1 0 5 0 0 1 2   - 4 R 3 +R 1 -------   1 0 0 - 3 0 1 0 5 0 0 1 2   This is now the augmented matrix of a very simple system of equations, namely x 1 = -3, x 2 = 5, x 3 = 2, which has an obvious solution. Furthermore, we can see that this is the only solution to this system, so we have determined the entire solution set, S = {[ - 3 5 2 ]} You might compare this example with the procedure we used in Example US. 4 Archetypes A and B are meant to contrast each other in many respects.

Research Should Start with Questions, Not Answers by Emily A.

Although we have not achieved parity in access to technology worldwide, information has never been easier to uncover. This is, of course, a double-edged sword: the proliferation of ideas due to the technological revolution enables new kinds of learning but also has fundamentally changed the way we think and interact. One of my friends refers to his iPhone as the \"Wonder Killer\": because he has such quick access to answers through the miniature computer he carries everywhere, the experience of sustained curiosity is now very rare in his life. All kinds of questions are easily answered by googling \"Who was that guy in Back to the Future Part II ?\" or \"Do spiders hibernate?\" or by taking a brief crawl through Wikipedia: \"How has globalization impacted Bhutan's economy?\" \"What life experiences influenced Frida Kahlo's painting?\" But the answers to these questions, though easily discovered, paint a very one-dimensional portrait of human knowledge. For scientists and writers alike, the spirit of curiosity motivates at once individual learning and also the growth and progress of our collective knowledge. Your innate ability to be curious puts you in the league of the most brilliant and prolific scholars--people who were driven by questions, seeking to interrogate the world around them. In this section, I add my voice to the chorus of writing teachers whose rallying cry is a renewed investment in curiosity. Hopefully, you too will embrace inquisitive fascination by rejecting easy answers and using writing as a means of discovery. It's possible that you've already written research papers by this point in your academic career. If your experience has been like mine, writing these papers went one of two ways: \n**1.** The teacher assigns a specific topic for you to research, and sometimes even a     specific thesis for you to prove. \n**2.** The teacher provides more freedom, allowing students to choose a topic at     their own discretion or from a set of options. \n#### INQUIRY-BASED RESEARCH \n 143 A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT \n In both situations, my teacher expected me to figure out what I wanted to argue, then find research to back me up. I was expected to have a fully formed stance on an issue, then use my sources to explain and support that stance. Not until graduate school did I encounter inquirybased research, which inverts this sequence. Put simply, inquiry-based research refers to research and research writing that is motivated by curiosity rather than a teacher's requirement. A Comparison of Research Styles Table 19.1 A chart comparing inquiry and non-inquiry-based research \n##### Non-inquiry-based research Inquiry-based research \nYour research begins with an answer and seeks out evidence that confirms that answer. Your research begins with a question, reviews all the evidence available, and then develops that answer. For example, a murder occurs, and I get a bad vibe from the butler. I look for all the clues that confirm that the butler did it; assuming I find what I need, I can declare that the butler did it. For example, a murder occurs. I look for as many clues as I can, then determine the most likely culprit based on that evidence. It's quite possible that the butler did do it, and both logical processes might lead me to the same conclusion. However, an inquiry-based investigation allows more consideration for the possibility that the butler is innocent. Consider the difference this can make: if research is about **learning** , then an inquiry-based perspective is essential. If you only seek out the ideas that agree with you, you will never learn. Even in the event that the investigation yields the same answers, their differences are crucial. When we only look for answers that agree with our preexisting ideas, we are more likely to ignore other important ideas, voices, and possibilities. Most importantly, **confirmation bias** inhibits genuine learning, which relies on challenging, expanding, and complicating our current knowledge and world views. Consequently, inquiry-based research is time-consuming and intensive: instead of only dealing with evidence that supports a certain answer or perspective, it requires the reasoner to encounter a great diversity of evidence and answers, which can be difficult to sift through. This distinction has important implications for the kind of research and research writing for which this book advocates.  You don't have to--shouldn't, in fact--have a thesis set in stone before starting your thesis, but you must be tremendously flexible: be prepared to pivot, qualify, nuance, or entirely change your answer as you proceed.  In order to pursue your research question, you will need to encounter _a lot_ of sources. Not all of the sources you encounter will make it into your paper, which is a new practice for some students. This is a time-consuming process, but it leads to more significant learning, more complex thinking, and more interesting and effective rhetoric. A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 144 \n Finding a conversation that you're excited about and genuinely interested in is the first and most important step. As you develop a topic, keep in mind that pursuing your curiosities and passions will make your research process less arduous, more relevant, and more pleasant. Such an approach will also naturally improve the quality of your writing: the interest you have for a topic will come across in the construction of your sentences and your willingness to pursue multiple lines of thought about a topic. An author's boredom results in a boring paper, and an author's enthusiasm translates to enthusiastic writing. Depending on the parameters your teacher has set, your research topic might need to (1) present a specific viewpoint, (2) focus on a specific topic, or (3) focus on a certain theme or set of ideas. It's also possible that your teacher will allow complete autonomy for one or all of your research assignments. Be sure you review any materials your instructor provides and ask clarifying questions to make sure your topic fits the guidelines of their assignment. To generate ideas, identify areas of interest, then develop questions of all sizes and types. Eventually, you will zero in on a question or combination of questions as your path of inquiry. What makes for a good research question or path of inquiry? Of course, the answer to this question will depend on your rhetorical situation. However, there are some common characteristics of a good research question in any situation: Engaging and fruitful research questions require complex, informed answers. However, they shouldn't be so subjective, intricate, or expansive that they simply cannot be answered in the scope of your rhetorical situation. By establishing parameters on your scope, you can be sure your research is directed and relevant. Research questions and the rhetoric they inform are valuable only because they have stakes: even if it's a small demographic, the answers to your research question should impact someone. As discussed earlier in this chapter, inquiry-based research should encourage you to articulate a unique standpoint by synthesizing many different voices, interpreted from your individual perspective, with your life experiences and ideas. What you say doesn't have to be groundbreaking, but it shouldn't just reiterate ideas, arguments, histories, or perspectives. \n#### DEVELOPING A RESEARCH QUESTION \n##### 1. It is answerable but not easily answerable. \n##### 2. It is specific. \n##### 3. It matters to someone. \n##### 4. It allows you to say something new or unique. \n 145 COLLECTED WORKS \n It is difficult to find a question that hits all these marks on your first try. As you proceed through research, prewriting, drafting, and revising, you should refine and adjust your question(s). Just like any other part of writing, developing a path of inquiry is iterative: you've got to take a lot of chances and work your way toward different results. In order to find the best version of your research question, you should develop \"working questions\"--questions of all sizes and types that are pertinent to your subject. As you can see below, you can start with a handful of simple working questions that will eventually lead to a viable research question. Revising Simple Questions into Research Questions Table 19.2 Chart showing the steps of revising a research question from working question to research question \n##### Beginning \n##### interest \n##### Working question \n##### Working research \n##### question \n##### Revised research question \n##### Vietnamese \n##### food and \n##### culture \n What do people eat in Vietnam? Too easy to answer; low stakes; not specific enough What does Vietnamese food reflect about Vietnamese culture? Higher stakes, more specific How does Vietnamese cuisine reflect a history of colonialism? More complex answers, higher stakes, very specific \n##### Health \n Are people in the United States more obese than they used to be? Too straightforward, not specific enough Have obesity rates increased in the United States over the last one hundred years? More specific Is there a correlation between obesity rates and economic instability in the United States over the last one hundred years? More complex answers, higher stakes, very specific \n##### World \n##### religion \n What is the role of religion in the Middle East? Not specific enough, difficult to answer in depth How has religion influenced politics in the Middle East in the last fifty years? More specific, easier to answer How has religion's influence on government impacted the day-to-day lives of Qatari citizens? Very specific, higher stakes, more complex answers As you hone your path of inquiry, you may need to zoom in or out in terms of scope: depending on your rhetorical situation, you will need different degrees of focus. Just like narration, research writing benefits from a careful consideration of scope. Often, a narrower scope is easier to work with than a broader scope--you will be able to write more and write better if your question asks for more complex thinking. It's important to be flexible throughout your research project. Be prepared to pivot topics, adjust your research question, change your opinions, and confront unanticipated challenges. As you build a working knowledge of your topic, you might complicate or narrow your working questions.

Since the binary number 0110 is positive six, that must mean that what we started with - 1010 - must be negative six. \n### Chapter 8 \n## Logic \nTo a great extent, logic governs the way your mind works, even among so-called \"irrational people.\" If we want to capture logical processes and represent them in a computer program, we need a way to express these thoughts in a form suitable for automated reasoning. This is primarily why computer scientists study logic. \nInterestingly, the material in this chapter covers the very bottom and the very top of the technology stack. At the bottom, we have actual physical hardware that consists of circuits turning bits on and off. The rules that govern when we want to turn which bits on and off are based on \"logic gates,\" or tiny physical devices that implement the logical principles of this chapter on a micro scale. At the other end of the spectrum, we have highly abstract programs aiming towards \"artificial intelligence.\" These systems are centered around a \"knowledge base\" of accumulated facts, and regularly examine those known facts to make decisions and draw additional conclusions. What does a knowledge base consist of? You guessed it: logical statements that are described in this chapter. \n**8.1 Propositional logic** \nThe simpler -- but less powerful -- of the two logic systems we'll study is called **propositional logic**. It has this name because the core building block is the **proposition**. A proposition is simply a \n 197 \n198 CHAPTER 8. LOGIC \nstatement that has a \"truth value,\" which means that it is either true or false. The statement \"all plants are living beings\" could be a proposition, as could \"Barack Obama was the first AfricanAmerican President\" and \"Kim Kardashian will play the title role in _Thor: Love and Thunder_ .\" By contrast, questions like \"are you okay?\" cannot be propositions, nor can commands like \"hurry up and answer already!\" or phrases like \"Lynn's newborn schnauzer,\" because they are not statements that can be true or false. (Linguistically speaking, propositions have to be in the indicative mood.) \nWe normally use capital letters (what else?) to denote propositions, like: \n Let A be the proposition that UMW is in Virginia. Let B be the proposition that the King of England is female. Let C be the proposition that dogs are carnivores. \nDon't forget that a proposition doesn't have to be true in order to be a valid proposition (B is still a proposition, for example). It just matters that it is labeled and that it has the potential to be true or false. \nPropositions are considered **atomic**. This means that they are _indivisible_ : to the logic system itself, or to a computer program, they are simply an opaque chunk of truth (or falsity) called \"A\" or whatever. When we humans read the description of A, we realize that it has to do with the location of a particular institution of higher education, and with the state of the union that it might reside (or not reside) in. All this is invisible to an artificially intelligent agent, however, which treats \"A\" as nothing more than a stand-in label for a statement that has no further discernible structure. \nSo things are pretty boring so far. We can define and label propositions, but none of them have any connections to the others. We change that by introducing **logical operators** (also called **logical connectives** ) with which we can build up compound constructions out of multiple propositions. The six connectives we'll learn are: \n8.1. PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC 199 \n  -- \"and\" ! -- \"not\"  -- \"or\" = -- \"implies\" (or \"if... then... \")  -- \"xor\" (exclusive \"or\") = -- \"equiv\" (equivalent) \nJust as the ordinary algebraic operators (+, -, _etc._ ) can be used to join numbers and produce another number, and just as the set operators can be used to join sets and produce another set, the logical operators can be used to join propositions and produce another proposition. The expression \"34 + 59\" produces the number 93. The expression \"{X,Y}{Y,Z}\" produces the set {X,Y,Z}. And the expression \"A  B\" produces the value false, since although UMW is located in Virginia, the King is not female. \nLet's run through the six operators, some of which are intuitive and some of which are not: \n **(\"and\")** The proposition XY is true when both X and Y are true propositions. \"AC\" represents the proposition \"UMW is in Virginia _and_ dogs are carnivores,\" which has a truth value of true since both components are true. This operation is sometimes called a **conjunction**. Notice that the \"\" sign somewhat resembles the \"\" sign for set intersection. This is not an accident. An element is in the intersection of two sets if it is a member of the first _and_ the second set. Hence mathematicians have chosen symbols which reinforce this connection. \n **(\"or\")** The proposition XY is true when either X or Y (or both) are true propositions. \"BC\" represents the proposition \"The King of England is female _or_ dogs are carnivores,\" which has a truth value of true since the second component is true. This operation is sometimes called a **disjunction**. The  looks somewhat like the \"\" sign for set union, since an element is in the union of two sets if it is an element of the first set _or_ the second set (or both). This operator is sometimes called an \"inclusive or\" since it is true if both propositions are true. \n200 CHAPTER 8. LOGIC \n **(\"xor\")** The  operator is just like  except that it's _exclusive_ : the proposition XY is true when _either_ X _or_ Y (but not both) are true propositions. \"BC\" and \"BC\" are both true, but \"AC\" is false, since UMW is in Virginia _and_ dogs are carnivores. \n! **(\"not\")** This operator is different from the others in that it's _unary_ , which means that it only operates on one proposition instead of two. All it does is flip the value from true to false (or vice versa.) The proposition \"A\" is true, but the proposition \"!A\" is false. \"!B,\" on the other hand, is true. This operation is sometimes called a **negation**. \n= **(\"implies\")** Okay, now for the toughest one. We're going to spend significant time thinking through this one carefully, because it's both important (in some ways, the most important of the operators) and also potentially baffling. I've studied this stuff for years, and I still sometimes get stuck when trying to figure out =. \n If we say \"X=Y,\" we're claiming that \" if X is true, then Y is true.\" Note carefully that we are not claiming that X itself is true. We're simply asserting that if it's true, then Y must necessarily also be true. We call the first part of a = proposition the premise , and the second part the conclusion. Here, X is the premise and Y the conclusion. \n So far, it seems easy. It gets a little slippery when you realize that the only claim \"X=Y\" is making is: \" if X is true, then Y must be true\". If X is not true, then \"X=Y\" is making no claim at all. \n Confusingly enough, this means that except for the one scenario where X is true but Y is false, the statement \"X=Y itself\" is always true. So, besides the obviously sensible case when X and Y are both true, X=Y is true even when: (1) X is false and Y is true, and (2) X is false and Y is false. Or, to put it succinctly: X=Y is true whenever either X is false or Y is true or both. \n8.1. PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC 201 \n For example, A=C is a true proposition, believe it or not. In English, it says \"UMW being in Virginia implies that dogs are carnivores.\" The proposition B=A is also true: \"The King of England being female implies that UMW is in Virginia.\" What possible sense can we make out of these nonsensical claims? \n The key to understanding it, for me at least, is twofold. First, remember that to a computer (or a logic system), there is no meaning to the propositions: they're simply atomic building blocks, each of which is true or false. So the fact that to a human, the content of the propositions might have nothing to do with each other -- English Kings and dogs -- is irrelevant to a computer: it just thinks indifferently in terms of \"X\" and \"Y,\" and has no idea what real-world entities any of this refers to. Second, think in terms of ruling out counterexamples. When I assert X=Y, what I'm saying is \"it's impossible for X to be true and Y false, because X's truthfulness would imply Y's truthfulness.\" Just as when I assert XY I'm promising that either X or Y is true (or both), when I assert X=Y I'm promising that either X is false or Y is true (or both). \n In this way, it starts to make sense when someone says, \"Iowa being in the Southern hemisphere implies that Batman's cape is red.\" That assertion is like a promise: \" if it turns out that Iowa is in the Southern hemisphere, then I guarantee Batman's cape is red.\" But since Iowa isn't in the Southern hemisphere, all bets are off. The conclusion was conditional on the premise. \n The reason this operator is so important is that in artificial intelligence, the name of the game is concluding new facts from known existing facts, so that knowledge is increased. Every time a 'bot learns that X=Y is true, and then also learns that the premise (X) is true, it can conclude that the conclusion (Y) is true, even if it was never explicitly told that Y was true. This rule of logic is called modus ponens , and is the workhorse of automated knowledge bases. \n202 CHAPTER 8. LOGIC \n= **(\"equiv\")** Finally, the proposition X=Y is true whenever X and Y have the same value: they're either both true, or both false. This can be seen as \"implies in both directions,\" since X=Y means \"if X is true, then Y is true; and if Y is true, then X is true.\" This operator is also the inverse of , since XY is true only if X and Y are different, and X=Y is true only if they're the same. \nThese operators, which each produce another proposition (called a **compound proposition** ) from the proposition(s) they operate on, can be combined to form complex expressions.

This works out to 256, but we can't actually store the number 256 in a byte if we're using the bit pattern 000000002 (or 0016 ) to represent zero. The highest value would be 111111112 (or FF 16 ), which is 25610. How do we store a number larger than that? Simply use more than one byte, of course. If we used two bytes of memory, and treated them as concatenated one after the other, that would give us 16 bits, allowing us to store up to the number 00000000000000002 = FFFF 16 = 65,535 10. We'd call one of these bytes -- the one representing the 20 's place up to the 27 's place -- the least significant _byte_ , and the other one -- containing places 28 through 215 -- the most significant byte. Extending to more than two bytes to accommodate even larger numbers is done in the obvious way. \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 183 \n**Binary representation schemes** \nThat's mostly all there is to it. But there's one thing we haven't discussed yet, and that's _negative_ numbers. We know how to represent any positive number (or zero) with an ordinary place value scheme. But how do we store a number like - 5? \nThere are three different schemes for treating negative numbers, each with its strengths and weaknesses. \n**Unsigned** \nThe simplest scheme is called **unsigned** , and it simply means that we don't _allow_ negative numbers. For one byte, we have 256 different bit patterns at our disposal, and we might just choose to allocate them all to represent positive numbers, so as to get the widest range. This makes sense for, say, a C++ program variable called heightInInches which we know can never meaningfully be negative (no one has a negative height). \nThe advantage of this scheme is simply that we can represent the greatest possible range of positive numbers, which is sometimes the goal. Each of the alternative schemes carves off a chunk of these available bit patterns and devotes them to representing negative numbers, leaving fewer left over for positive numbers. There's no free lunch: you have to decide how you want to \"spend\" your available bit patterns depending on what values you need to represent. \n**Sign-magnitude** \nThe **sign-magnitude** scheme is probably the first thing you'd think of to solve the negative number representation problem. We need to store the sign of the number somehow, and a sign is inherently a two-valued thing (either positive or negative), so why not peel off one of the bits and use it to represent the sign? The remaining bits can then be used in the ordinary way to represent the magnitude of the number. \nThe way this is most often done is to take the left-most bit and use it as the **sign bit**. This bit now has _no other meaning_. It \n184 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \ncan't \"double\" as the 128's place, because then there'd be no way to distinguish between, say, 129 and - 129 (each would be represented with 10000001 .) No, the sign bit must be considered \"spent money,\" and its expressive power cannot be reclaimed to also represent part of the magnitude. By convention, if the sign bit is 0 this represents a _positive_ number, and a sign bit of 1 represents a _negative_ number. (That might seem counterintuitive, but hey, that's the way it is.) \nSo this number in sign-magnitude: \n 0 0100110 \nrepresents the decimal number 38. That's because the sign bit (bolded, on the far left) is 0, which means the number is positive. The magnitude of the number is contained in the other 7 bits, which gives 32 + 4 + 2 = 38. This number, on the other hand: \n 1 0100110 \nrepresents - 38. The magnitude is the same, but the sign bit is 1 so this pattern now \"means\" a negative number. \nClearly we have reduced our range of positive numbers in exchange for the ability to also store negatives. We have 7 bits of range instead of 8, so instead of 255, our highest possible value is merely \n127. On the other end, the lowest possible value is - 127. \nIf you have sharp eyes, you may have noticed a discrepancy in the counting. With the sign-magnitude approach, we can hold numbers in the range - 127 to 127. But wait: that's only 255 different values, not 256! Why did we lose one value of expressive power? The answer is that the sign-magnitude scheme has _two ways_ of representing _zero_. The bit pattern 00000000 is obviously zero, but so is 10000000 (which you might call \"negative zero.\") Using two different patterns to represent the same value is a little wasteful, but the situation is actually worse than that. Having to account for both patterns means that computer hardware using the signmagnitude scheme is inevitably more complicated. To compare two \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 185 \nbytes to see if they're equal, you'd think we'd just compare each bit position, and if they were all the same, the bytes would be declared equal, otherwise no. Alas, this is no longer quite that simple. The two zero patterns must be considered numerically equal, so our digital logic now has to contain a special case. \"To be equal, all the bits have to be the same... oh, but actually not if the right-most seven are all zeroes in both bytes. In that case, it doesn't matter what the left-most bit contains.\" Maddening. \n**Two's-complement** \nThis shortcoming in the sign-magnitude scheme is remedied with the **two's-complement** scheme, which is the one actually used most often in practice. It'll seem weird at first -- certainly not as intuitive as the first two -- but it leads to a critically important feature that we'll look at shortly. \nFirst, the rules. To interpret a two's-complement number, you: \n1. Look at the left-most bit (just like in sign-magnitude). If     it's a 0, you have a positive number. If it's a 1, you have a     negative number. \n2. If it's a positive number, the other 7 bits give you the mag-     nitude (just like in sign-magnitude). \n3. If, however, it's a negative number, then to discover the mag-     nitude of that negative number you must _flip all the bits and_     _add one_. This will give you a positive number which is the     absolute value of your negative number. \nEasy example: take the byte 00100110. The left-most bit is a 0, which means it's a positive number, and as we discovered above, the remaining 7 bits give a magnitude of 38. So this is the number 38. \nHarder example: take the byte 10100110. The left-most bit is a 1, which means it's negative. Okay: negative _what_? How do we find the magnitude? Well, we \"flip\" all the bits ( _i.e._ , invert each one \n186 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \nfrom 0 to 1 or vice versa) to get: \n 01011001 \nand then add one to the result: \n 1 01011001 + 1 01011010 \nThis black magic produces the value 010110102 , which converts to 9010. **This means that the original number, 10100110 , corresponds to the value -90.** \n\"Flipping all the bits and adding one\" is the cookbook procedure for taking the complement (negative) of a number in the two'scomplement scheme. It works in reverse, too. Let's start with 90 this time and crank through the process again, making sure we get -90. \nStart with the binary representation of 9010 : \n 01011010 \nFlip all the bits to get: 10100101 \nand finally add one to the result: \n 1 10100101 + 1 10100110 \nWe get 10100110 , which was precisely the number we originally began with, and which we have already determined represents -90. \nNow you may ask what we gain from all this. Surely this scheme is considerably more convoluted than the simple idea of reserving one bit as a sign bit, and treating the rest as a magnitude. But it turns out there is indeed a method to the madness. Strange as \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 187 \nit sounds, a two's-complement representation scheme allows us to _perform addition and subtraction with a single operation._ \nIn first grade (or so), you learned the procedure for adding multidigit numbers, which we've followed several times in this chapter. It involves adding the digits right-to-left and possibly \"carrying.\" Then in second grade (or so), you learned the procedure for _subtracting_ multi-digit numbers. It involves subtracting the digits right-to-left and possibly \"borrowing.\" If you're like me, you found adding easier than subtracting. It's easy to just carry the one, but to borrow requires looking at the digit to the left, making sure that you _can_ borrow from it ( _i.e._ , that it's not already 0), borrowing from further left until you actually find an available non-zero value, hoping the number on the bottom is actually less than the one on the top (because otherwise you have to switch the order and then add a negative sign to the result), and keeping all of that straight as you march down the line. \nEven if you didn't find subtracting more difficult than adding, though, you can't argue that it's still a completely _different_ algorithm, with different rules to follow. In computer hardware, we have to implement different circuitry to perform each operation, which is more difficult, costly, error-prone, and power-draining. \nThe wonderful thing about two's-complement, however, is that with this scheme we actually _never need to use the subtraction algorithm._ If we want to subtract two numbers -- say, 24 - 37 -- we can instead take the complement of the second number and then add them. Instead of 24 - 37 we compute 24 + (-37). \nLet's see it in action. Using conversion procedures, we can figure out that 2410 is: \n 00011000 \nand that _positive_ 3710 is: \n 00100101 \nIf we wanted to compute 24 + 37, we'd just add these. But instead we're looking for 24 - 37 , so we'll take the complement of 37 to find \n188 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \n- 37. Flip all the bits of 37: \n 11011010 \nand add one: 1 1011010 + 1 1 1011011 \nand so now we've determined that in the two's-complement scheme, - 37 is represented by 110110112. \nWe're now ready to compute 24 + (-37): \n 1 1 \n00011000 - this is (^2410) + 11011011 - this is - (^3710) 11110011 So we have our two's-complement answer, 11110011. What value does that correspond to? Well, the left-most bit is a 1, so it's a negative number. To find out what it's the negative _of_ , flip all the bits and add one: 0 0001100 - flip the bits to get + 1 - add one 0 0001101 This is positive 13, which means the number we inverted to get it -- 11110011 -- must represent - 13. And that is indeed the correct answer, for 24 - 37 = - 13. One last word on two's-complement: what is the _range_ of numbers we can represent? It turns out to be -128 to 127. The highest value is 01111111 , which is 127. You might think the lowest value would be represented as 11111111 , but if you work it out, you'll find that this is actually the number - 1. The lowest number is actually the bit pattern 10000000 , which is - 128. **Overflow** One last sticky detail we need to cover has to do with **overflow**. When we add two numbers, there is the possibility that the result \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 189 \nwill contain one more digit than the original numbers did. You've probably seen this on a hand calculator when you press \"=\" and get an \"E\" (for \"error\") in the display. If there are only ten digits on your display, adding two ten-digit numbers will (sometimes) result in an eleven-digit number that your calculator can't display, and it's alerting you to that fact so you don't misinterpret the result. Here, we might add two 8-bit quantities and end up with a 9-bit quantity that can't fit in one byte. This situation is called overflow, and we need to detect when it occurs. \nThe rules for detecting overflow are different depending on the scheme. For _unsigned_ numbers, the rule is simple: if a 1 is carried out from the MSB (far left-side), then we have overflow. So if I were to try to add 15510 and 10810 : \n 1 1 1 1 \n10011011 - (^15510) + 01101100 - (^10810) 1 00001111 then I get a carry out left into the 9th digit. Since we can only hold eight digits in our result, we would get a nonsensical </passage>"}], "prediction": "<tool_call>\n{'arguments': <args-dict>, 'name': 'ExpertQAExtractor'}\n</tool_call>\nFor each extraction function call return a json object with function name and arguments followed by a <tool_call> tag with the following schema:\n<tools>\n[{'type': 'function', 'function': {'name': 'ExpertQAExtractor', 'description': 'Extracts a list of questions that ask for clarification on an ambiguous or unclear statement in the document.

As writers, it is a powerful tool to be able to move back and forth between stylistic modes and communication styles--the better to reach our readers. The following elements of style (in alphabetical order) are just some of the areas where you can make these writerly choices. \n##### Concise Writing \n Concision is the opposite of wordiness. Concise writing is tight and bright; it is clear and content-rich. In other words, it contains no additional fluff or unnecessary words. Why is fluff a problem, at a sentence or paragraph level? Why does this matter, do you think? In the worst cases, wordiness leads to whole paragraphs of fluff and repetition. Sometimes this happens when students are asked to meet a page-length requirement for an assignment. \"How can I possibly write five to six pages about the Endangered Species Act?\" you may wonder. That's a great question and one you could work on with your instructor--but the answer should ultimately boil down to better content, not fluff paragraphs. (A few ideas: add a counterargument, bring in another source, give an example, ask a more complex question, etc.) A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 202 \nIn most writing, though, wordiness happens unconsciously. The kinds of extra words that we add in conversation can make a written sentence confusing and less impactful. Because writing is a more crafted form of communication, we can take the time to edit ourselves and remove the fluff for a stronger final product. Consider the following examples: _Wordy:_ The author of this article, Dr. Belinda Jackson, who is a psychologist and researches cognition, makes the argument that metacognition is very helpful for student learning. _Concise:_ Cognitive psychologist Dr. Belinda Jackson argues that metacognition improves student learning. Notice that the _content_ of the sentence didn't change. Concision is not about simplifying your ideas or removing important details. Instead, the goal is to remove unnecessary words that dilute or confuse the sentence. A more concise sentence is easier to understand and therefore makes a stronger impact. In fact, it leaves room for _more_ content: a concise writer can pack an incredible amount of information and ideas into a paragraph. Conciseness is an ongoing exercise for all writers. Here are a few tips to make your writing more concise:  Remove unnecessary repetition. For example, a \"slow, unhurried, leisurely stroll\" could be rewritten as simply \"a leisurely stroll.\"  Remove empty modifiers--adjectives and adverbs that don't significantly contribute to the meaning of the sentence and are used only to intensify the word they are modifying. The most common ones are _very, really, pretty, totally,_ and _just_.  Use an active voice when it makes sense to do so. More on this in the \"Passive and Active Voice\" section below.  Combine sentences to avoid repetition. For example, this version is wordy: \"I went to the store. The store was Winco. They were closed.\" A more concise version would be \"I went to Winco, but they were closed.\" Notice that concise writing does not always mean short, simple sentences. As Strunk and White put it in their famous book _The Elements of Style_ , That's a high bar but something to aspire to as you work to make your writing concise and content-rich. Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell. (46) 203 COLLECTED WORKS \n##### Correctness \n Many writers feel concerned about \"grammar\" (I used quote marks here because often what they really mean is clarity, syntax, punctuation, or even spelling--any kind of English usage or mechanics). Often, these writers have been told that their writing contains errors or that it's difficult to understand. This can happen for many reasons. Knowledge of mechanics and English usage comes from a combination of the language or dialect you spoke growing up, the way you process language, your exposure to written language, and more. This anxiety can be exacerbated by encounters with \"grammar Nazis\"--people who take it upon themselves to get out their (literal or figurative) red pen and tell you (and the world) exactly what you've done wrong. You may have a grammar stickler in your own life, and the internet is certainly full of them. We've all seen the correction *you're as a saucy retort to haters in the comments section (one of the most satisfying and, it has to be said, pedantic responses out there). The internet itself--and all digital communication--is a great example of how language and English usage are constantly in flux. How often do you see a period at the end of a text message--and if you do, what did you do to make the writer angry? How long has the phrase \"because internet\" been considered a complete thought? Internet linguistics is fascinating in its own right, but I bring it up here as an example of a larger point: grammar is made up. Yes, there are some stylistic and usage choices that make our meaning clearer and more graceful, but some rules are arbitrary and were invented by eighteenthand nineteenth-century grammarians. (\"Never end a sentence with a preposition,\" I'm looking at you--an arbitrary rule if I ever heard one.) There is something to be said for correctness. Errors can distract readers from ideas or make meaning murky, and it is true that others may judge us (again, unfairly) for errors and typos in our emails. (Interestingly, one study suggests that the people most bothered by these kinds of errors are not united by age, education, or time spent reading; instead, their commonality is personality type. Extroverts are more willing to overlook written errors that introverted people may judge negatively [Boland and Queen].) In the field of rhetoric and composition, though, we have moved away from a heavy emphasis on correct usage in the past few years. While there is value in correctness, the most important thing is for your meaning to be clear and your ideas to be sound. Too much focus on where the apostrophe goes can detract from the larger issues of how to build an argument, support a stance, or structure an essay. We need to work on those global aspects of writing before getting down to the nitty-gritty of comma usage. As Stephen Pinker put it, For all the vitriol brought out by matters of correct usage, they are the smallest part of good writing. They pale in importance behind coherence, classic style and overcoming the curse of knowledge, to say nothing of standards of intellectual conscientiousness. If you really want to improve the quality of your writing, or if you want to thunder about sins in the writing of others, the principles you should worry about the most are not the ones that govern fused participles and possessive antecedents but the ones that govern critical thinking and factual diligence. (485) A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 204 \n In other words, grammar and usage are only a small part of the larger writing picture. Your instructor may note patterns of error or point out places where a comma would make your writing clearer--but it will not be the primary focus of most college writing classes. However, when you leave school, it will be up to you to judge the rhetorical situation of any piece of writing and handle correctness accordingly. You already know this subconsciously; just think again about the example of texting a friend versus emailing an instructor. English usage and mechanics are another way to make your writing more effective, powerful, and clear. Think of them as tools to help you strengthen the rhetorical impact of your words and ideas. How can you use these tools to clarify your meaning and help your readers focus on the good stuff? See the \"Additional Resources\" and \"Activities\" sections for more practical and specific guidance on comma usage and more. \n##### Passive And Active Voice \n Maybe this is a familiar phrase: \"Ugh, he's so passive! Why won't he speak up for himself?\" When we describe a person as passive, we mean that they let things happen to them. They don't take action; instead, they allow things to happen without resistance. That definition is helpful when learning about passive voice in writing as well. In passive voice, the object (or recipient) of the action becomes the subject of the sentence. In other words, the focus is on who (or what) received the action rather than on who (or what) completed the action. Here's an example to show you what I mean: Passive: The coffee was drunk by Poppy. Active: Poppy drank the coffee. Both of these sentences are grammatically correct, but as you can see, they have some notable differences. The passive construction is a little longer, and it emphasizes the coffee (the recipient of the action) rather than Poppy (the doer of the action). The active version is more concise, and it focuses on Poppy and her actions. These may seem like small differences, but they add up over the course of a paper. Active voice is often considered sharper, clearer, and cleaner than passive voice. In the example above, you can see why. So why would anyone ever use passive voice? Well, in some cases, the doer of the action is unknown or irrelevant, as in \"The package was delivered this morning\" (passive). We don't know who delivered it, and while the delivery person matters as a human, they don't matter in the meaning of this sentence. In other cases, the receiver of the action is more important than the doer; we emphasize the recipient of the action because that's what matters in the context of the sentence. For example, we almost always say, \"She was born in 1994,\" which is a passive construction. In this situation, who did the action (her mother) is not the most relevant information. If we wrote, \"Her mother gave birth to her in 1994\" (active voice), we would be making a conscious decision to highlight her mother's role in the moment. 205 COLLECTED WORKS \n This is often true in technical and scientific writing as well, which is why the passive voice is more common in STEM fields. In a lab report, for example, the experiment is more important than the researcher; for that reason, it's common to write in the passive voice. For example, \"Hydrochloric acid was then added\" (passive) is more common than \"I added hydrochloric acid.\" We also often use passive voice to avoid blaming others in a negative situation. In some cases, this is considered the most polite route. It may feel accusatory or aggressive to say, \"You did this assignment incorrectly\" (active). Instead, we might say, \"This assignment was done incorrectly.\" Again, both are correct, but we can make a writerly choice here to focus on the receiver of the action (the assignment) and in this case spare someone's feelings. However, be careful! The passive voice is sometimes used in this way to avoid taking responsibility. Newspapers famously use passive voice in a way that emphasizes the victims rather than the criminals. Politicians, corporations, and regular people also use the passive voice to duck blame or responsibility. Consider the following examples: Passive: She was assaulted at a party. Active: An unknown male assaulted her at a party. Passive: Authors of color have been historically marginalized by the publishing industry. Active: Historically, the publishing industry marginalized authors of color. Passive: Mistakes were made. Active: We made a mistake. (Or even more unthinkable: I made a mistake.) How does the active voice shift the focus of the sentence and potentially the cultural framing of sexual assault, racism, and other errors? You can see how the use of active or passive voice can be a political choice as well as a stylistic one. Passive voice isn't grammatically incorrect, and it has its place. The key (as with all elements of style) is to consider how its use impacts your writing. Notice it and make a choice about when to use it and when to cut it. You can check your own writing for passive voice. Does the \"doer\" of the action come after the action (the thing that was done)? Or does the doer disappear completely? If so, the sentence is likely in a passive voice. You can also look for this construction in your sentences: \n##### Point Of View: To \"I\" Or Not To \"I\" \n As a general rule, an \"I\" voice will give your writing a more personal and subjective feel. That's why a first-person perspective is common in memoirs and personal essays but rarely seen in STEM fields (although some scientific articles do refer to the researchers as \"we,\" which is a personal pronoun but somehow slightly less intimate than \"I\"). Academic writing in the humanities and social sciences is somewhere in between these two extremes--depending on the subject and context, a writer can make their own choice. Many well-known scholars in these fields use an \"I\" in their academic papers, especially if their connection to the subject \n### \"TO BE\" VERB (IS, ARE, WAS, ETC.) + \n### PAST PARTICIPLE (WALKED, TAKEN, \n### SEEN, ETC.) = PASSIVE VOICE \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 206 \n is important to understanding their perspective or point. Some authors use it just a little bit--maybe they open their article with a personal anecdote before moving into a more objective tone--while others use it throughout a piece of writing. It's worth noting that although writing without the \"I\" can be read as more objective, all writing is created by people with perspectives and stances. If I make an argument, it doesn't matter if I frame it with \"I argue\" or not; it's still my argument. From one perspective, then, using an \"I\" voice is simply more transparent about the subjectivity of the work. The \"I\" voice is slightly less formal, although it can still have a place in academic writing. It can also feel quite personal, depending on the subject.

(Step 1) Now compute 1838 mod 16. This gives us the value     14, which is of course a base 10 number. The equivalent hex     digit is E. So we now write down E to the left of the 3: \nE3 \n4. (Step 2) Dividing 1838 by 16 and taking the floor gives us \n114. Since this is again not zero, we perform step 2b: make 114 our new value, move our pencil to the left of the E, and go back to step 1. \n5. (Step 1) Next we compute 114 mod 16. This turns out to be     2, so we write down a 2: \n2E3 \n176 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \n6. (Step 2) Computing  114 / 16  produces 7, which is again not     zero, so 7 becomes our new value and we go back once again     to step 2b. \n7. (Step 1) 7 mod 16 is simply 7, so we write it down: \n72E3 \n8. (Step 2) Finally,  7 / 16  is zero, so we go to step 2a and     we're done. The page has 72E3 written on it in big bold     letters, which is the correct answer. \n**Adding hex numbers** \nSuppose we have two hexadecimal numbers, and we want to add them together to get a hexadecimal result. How do we do it? One way is to first convert them both to decimal, then add them like you learned in first grade, then convert the answer back to hex. But we can stay \"natively hex\" as long as we add each pair of digits correctly. \nLet's try it. Suppose we want to compute this sum: \n48 D (^416) +59 2 5 16 ? 16 We proceed in the first-grade way from right to left. Adding the one's-place values, we get 4 + 5 = 9: 48 D (^416) +59 2 5 16 (^916) Easy enough. Now we add the next digit to the left (the sixteen'splace, mind you, not the ten's place) and we find D + 2. Now what in the world is \"D+2\"? It's actually easy: all you have to do is the same thing you did when you were a child and you had to add something like 4 + 5. You hadn't memorized the answer \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 177 \nyet, and so you started with four fingers held up, and counted off \"1... 2... 3... 4... 5,\" sticking up another finger each time. Then, you looked at your hands, and behold! nine fingers. \nWe'll do the same thing here: start with the number \"D,\" and count two additional places: \"E... F.\" The answer is F. That is the number that's two greater than D. Lucky for us, it still fits in one digit. So now we have: \n48 D (^416) +59 2 5 16 F (^916) So far so good. The next pair of digits is 8 + 9. Here's where you want to be careful. You're liable to look at \"8+9\" and immediately say \"17!\" But 8 + 9 is _not_ 17 in hexadecimal. To figure out what it is, we start with the number 8, and count: \"9... A... B... C... D... E... F... 10... 11... \". The answer is \"11,\" which of course is how you write \"seventeen\" in hex. So just like in grade school, we write down 1 and carry the 1: 1 48 D (^416) +59 2 5 16 1 F (^916) Finally, our last digit is 4 + 5, plus the carried 1. We start with four and count off five: \"5... 6... 7... 8... 9.\" Then we add the carry, and count \"... A.\" The answer is A, with no carry, and so we have our final answer: 1 4 8D (^416) + 5 9 2 5 16 **A1F9 16 7.4 Binary (base 2)** The other base we commonly use in computer science is base 2, or **binary**. This is because the basic unit of information in a computer is called a **bit** , which has only two values, conventionally called either \"true\" and \"false\" or \"1\" and \"0\". Numbers (as well \n178 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \nas everything else) are ultimately represented as colossal sequences of 1's and 0's, which are of course binary numbers. \nThe rules for interpreting place value are the same: \n 1101012 = 1 x 25 + 1 x 24 + 0 x 23 + 1 x 22 + 0 x 21 + 1 x 20 = 1 x 32 + 1 x 16 + 0 x 8 + 1 x 4 + 0 x 2 + 1 x 1 = 5310. \nSo in binary we have a one's-place, a two's-place, a four's-place, an eight's-place, and so on. We call the right-most place the **least significant bit (LSB)** and the left-most the **most significant bit (MSB)**. \nCounting up from zero is really just the same as any other base, although it feels a little strange in binary because you \"roll over\" so often: \n 02 zero 12 one 102 two 112 three 1002 four 1012 five 1102 six 1112 seven 10002 eight 10012 nine .. . \n .. . \n**Converting to and from decimal** \nConverting from binary to decimal was demonstrated above (with 1101012 = 53 10 .) To go the other way, we follow the algorithm from page 174. Let's try it for the decimal number 49: \n1. (Step 1) We first compute 49 mod 2. Doing \"mod 2\" is easy:     you just see whether the number is even or odd. In this case,     it's odd, so the remainder is a 1: \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 179 \n1 \n2. (Step 2) Now divide 49 by 2 and take the floor, which gives      49 / 2  = 24. It's not zero, so we perform step 2b: make 24     our new value, move our pencil to the left of the 1, and go     back to step 1. \n3. (Step 1) Compute 24 mod 2. Since 24 is even, this is zero,     which we write down to the left of the 1: \n01 \n4. (Step 2) Divide 24 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  24 /     2  = 12. Make 12 our new value, move our pencil to the left     of the 0, and go back to step 1. \n5. (Step 1) Compute 12 mod 2. Since 12 is even, this is zero,     which we write down: \n001 \n6. (Step 2) Divide 12 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  12 /     2  = 6. Make 6 our new value, move our pencil to the left of     the 0, and go back to step 1. \n7. (Step 1) Compute 6 mod 2. Since 6 is even, this is zero, which     we write down: \n0001 \n8. (Step 2) Divide 6 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  6 / 2  =     3. Make 3 our new value, move our pencil to the left of the     0, and go back to step 1. \n9. (Step 1) Compute 3 mod 2. Since 3 is odd, this is one, which     we write down: \n180 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \n10001 \n10. (Step 2) Divide 3 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  3 / 2  =     1. This still isn't zero, so make 1 our new value, move our     pencil to the left of the 0, and go back to step 1. \n11. (Step 1) Compute 1 mod 2. Since 1 is odd, this is one, which     we write down: \n110001 \n12. (Step 2) Divide 1 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  1 / 2  =     0. We're done. The final answer is 1100012. Double-checking     our work, we verify that indeed one 32 plus one 16 plus one     1 gives 49, which is what we started with. \n**Converting to and from hex** \nThat was pretty tedious. But converting back and forth from binary to _hex_ is a snap. That's because 16 is exactly 24 , and so one hex digit is exactly equal to four binary digits. This isn't the case with base 10, where one decimal digit is equal to three binary digits... _plus_ a little extra. This \"not quite a whole number of digits\" thing is what makes converting from decimal to binary (or decimal to hex, for that matter) so awkward. \nWe most commonly deal with sets of eight bits at a time, which is called a **byte**. (This is the fundamental unit of storage on pretty much every computer on earth.) Suppose I had the following byte: \n(^100001102) Because one hex digit is exactly equal to four bits, this byte is exactly equal to: (^8616) \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 181 \nThis is because the byte can be neatly split into two parts: 1000 , which corresponds to the hex digit 8, and 0110, which corresponds to the hex digit 6. These two halves are called **nibbles** -- one byte has two nibbles, and each nibble is one hex digit. At a glance, therefore, with no multiplying or adding, we can convert from binary to hex. \nGoing the other direction is just as easy. If we have: \n 3E 16 \nwe just convert each hex digit into the corresponding nibble: \n(^001111102) After you do this a while, you get to the point where you can instantly recognize which hex digit goes with which nibble value. Until then, though, here's a handy table: nibble hex digit 0000 0 0001 1 0010 2 0011 3 0100 4 0101 5 0110 6 0111 7 1000 8 1001 9 1010 A 1011 B 1100 C 1101 D 1110 E 1111 F In case you're wondering, yes this is worth memorizing. \n182 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \n**Adding binary numbers** \nAdding two binary numbers is the same as adding in decimal, hexadecimal, or any other base: you just have to know when to \"roll over the odometer,\" which in this case is almost instantly, since the highest value a bit can hold is 1! Let's give it a shot: \n(^1110012) + (^0110102) ? 2 A child could follow the rules: when we add two zeroes, we get zero. Adding a one to a zero gives one. Adding two ones gives zero, and a carry to the next significant digit. And adding two ones plus a carry gives a one and a carry. See if you can follow the flow: 1 1 (^1110012) + (^0110102) 1 010011 2 **Capacity** How large a value can a byte store? There are 8 bits, and each one can independently have either of two values (0 or 1), so by the Fundamental Theorem of Counting, there are 28 different combinations. This works out to 256, but we can't actually store the number 256 in a byte if we're using the bit pattern 000000002 (or 0016 ) to represent zero. The highest value would be 111111112 (or FF 16 ), which is 25610. How do we store a number larger than that? Simply use more than one byte, of course. If we used two bytes of memory, and treated them as concatenated one after the other, that would give us 16 bits, allowing us to store up to the number 00000000000000002 = FFFF 16 = 65,535 10. We'd call one of these bytes -- the one representing the 20 's place up to the 27 's place -- the least significant _byte_ , and the other one -- containing places 28 through 215 -- the most significant byte. Extending to more than two bytes to accommodate even larger numbers is done in the obvious way. \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 183 \n**Binary representation schemes** \nThat's mostly all there is to it. But there's one thing we haven't discussed yet, and that's _negative_ numbers. We know how to represent any positive number (or zero) with an ordinary place value scheme.

As writers, it is a powerful tool to be able to move back and forth between stylistic modes and communication styles--the better to reach our readers. The following elements of style (in alphabetical order) are just some of the areas where you can make these writerly choices. \n##### Concise Writing \n Concision is the opposite of wordiness. Concise writing is tight and bright; it is clear and content-rich. In other words, it contains no additional fluff or unnecessary words. Why is fluff a problem, at a sentence or paragraph level? Why does this matter, do you think? In the worst cases, wordiness leads to whole paragraphs of fluff and repetition. Sometimes this happens when students are asked to meet a page-length requirement for an assignment. \"How can I possibly write five to six pages about the Endangered Species Act?\" you may wonder. That's a great question and one you could work on with your instructor--but the answer should ultimately boil down to better content, not fluff paragraphs. (A few ideas: add a counterargument, bring in another source, give an example, ask a more complex question, etc.) A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 202 \nIn most writing, though, wordiness happens unconsciously. The kinds of extra words that we add in conversation can make a written sentence confusing and less impactful. Because writing is a more crafted form of communication, we can take the time to edit ourselves and remove the fluff for a stronger final product. Consider the following examples: _Wordy:_ The author of this article, Dr. Belinda Jackson, who is a psychologist and researches cognition, makes the argument that metacognition is very helpful for student learning. _Concise:_ Cognitive psychologist Dr. Belinda Jackson argues that metacognition improves student learning. Notice that the _content_ of the sentence didn't change. Concision is not about simplifying your ideas or removing important details. Instead, the goal is to remove unnecessary words that dilute or confuse the sentence. A more concise sentence is easier to understand and therefore makes a stronger impact. In fact, it leaves room for _more_ content: a concise writer can pack an incredible amount of information and ideas into a paragraph. Conciseness is an ongoing exercise for all writers. Here are a few tips to make your writing more concise:  Remove unnecessary repetition. For example, a \"slow, unhurried, leisurely stroll\" could be rewritten as simply \"a leisurely stroll.\"  Remove empty modifiers--adjectives and adverbs that don't significantly contribute to the meaning of the sentence and are used only to intensify the word they are modifying. The most common ones are _very, really, pretty, totally,_ and _just_.  Use an active voice when it makes sense to do so. More on this in the \"Passive and Active Voice\" section below.  Combine sentences to avoid repetition. For example, this version is wordy: \"I went to the store. The store was Winco. They were closed.\" A more concise version would be \"I went to Winco, but they were closed.\" Notice that concise writing does not always mean short, simple sentences. As Strunk and White put it in their famous book _The Elements of Style_ , That's a high bar but something to aspire to as you work to make your writing concise and content-rich. Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell. (46) 203 COLLECTED WORKS \n##### Correctness \n Many writers feel concerned about \"grammar\" (I used quote marks here because often what they really mean is clarity, syntax, punctuation, or even spelling--any kind of English usage or mechanics). Often, these writers have been told that their writing contains errors or that it's difficult to understand. This can happen for many reasons. Knowledge of mechanics and English usage comes from a combination of the language or dialect you spoke growing up, the way you process language, your exposure to written language, and more. This anxiety can be exacerbated by encounters with \"grammar Nazis\"--people who take it upon themselves to get out their (literal or figurative) red pen and tell you (and the world) exactly what you've done wrong. You may have a grammar stickler in your own life, and the internet is certainly full of them. We've all seen the correction *you're as a saucy retort to haters in the comments section (one of the most satisfying and, it has to be said, pedantic responses out there). The internet itself--and all digital communication--is a great example of how language and English usage are constantly in flux. How often do you see a period at the end of a text message--and if you do, what did you do to make the writer angry? How long has the phrase \"because internet\" been considered a complete thought? Internet linguistics is fascinating in its own right, but I bring it up here as an example of a larger point: grammar is made up. Yes, there are some stylistic and usage choices that make our meaning clearer and more graceful, but some rules are arbitrary and were invented by eighteenthand nineteenth-century grammarians. (\"Never end a sentence with a preposition,\" I'm looking at you--an arbitrary rule if I ever heard one.) There is something to be said for correctness. Errors can distract readers from ideas or make meaning murky, and it is true that others may judge us (again, unfairly) for errors and typos in our emails. (Interestingly, one study suggests that the people most bothered by these kinds of errors are not united by age, education, or time spent reading; instead, their commonality is personality type. Extroverts are more willing to overlook written errors that introverted people may judge negatively [Boland and Queen].) In the field of rhetoric and composition, though, we have moved away from a heavy emphasis on correct usage in the past few years. While there is value in correctness, the most important thing is for your meaning to be clear and your ideas to be sound. Too much focus on where the apostrophe goes can detract from the larger issues of how to build an argument, support a stance, or structure an essay. We need to work on those global aspects of writing before getting down to the nitty-gritty of comma usage. As Stephen Pinker put it, For all the vitriol brought out by matters of correct usage, they are the smallest part of good writing. They pale in importance behind coherence, classic style and overcoming the curse of knowledge, to say nothing of standards of intellectual conscientiousness. If you really want to improve the quality of your writing, or if you want to thunder about sins in the writing of others, the principles you should worry about the most are not the ones that govern fused participles and possessive antecedents but the ones that govern critical thinking and factual diligence. (485) A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 204 \n In other words, grammar and usage are only a small part of the larger writing picture. Your instructor may note patterns of error or point out places where a comma would make your writing clearer--but it will not be the primary focus of most college writing classes. However, when you leave school, it will be up to you to judge the rhetorical situation of any piece of writing and handle correctness accordingly. You already know this subconsciously; just think again about the example of texting a friend versus emailing an instructor. English usage and mechanics are another way to make your writing more effective, powerful, and clear. Think of them as tools to help you strengthen the rhetorical impact of your words and ideas. How can you use these tools to clarify your meaning and help your readers focus on the good stuff? See the \"Additional Resources\" and \"Activities\" sections for more practical and specific guidance on comma usage and more. \n##### Passive And Active Voice \n Maybe this is a familiar phrase: \"Ugh, he's so passive! Why won't he speak up for himself?\" When we describe a person as passive, we mean that they let things happen to them. They don't take action; instead, they allow things to happen without resistance. That definition is helpful when learning about passive voice in writing as well. In passive voice, the object (or recipient) of the action becomes the subject of the sentence. In other words, the focus is on who (or what) received the action rather than on who (or what) completed the action. Here's an example to show you what I mean: Passive: The coffee was drunk by Poppy. Active: Poppy drank the coffee. Both of these sentences are grammatically correct, but as you can see, they have some notable differences. The passive construction is a little longer, and it emphasizes the coffee (the recipient of the action) rather than Poppy (the doer of the action). The active version is more concise, and it focuses on Poppy and her actions. These may seem like small differences, but they add up over the course of a paper. Active voice is often considered sharper, clearer, and cleaner than passive voice. In the example above, you can see why. So why would anyone ever use passive voice? Well, in some cases, the doer of the action is unknown or irrelevant, as in \"The package was delivered this morning\" (passive). We don't know who delivered it, and while the delivery person matters as a human, they don't matter in the meaning of this sentence. In other cases, the receiver of the action is more important than the doer; we emphasize the recipient of the action because that's what matters in the context of the sentence. For example, we almost always say, \"She was born in 1994,\" which is a passive construction. In this situation, who did the action (her mother) is not the most relevant information. If we wrote, \"Her mother gave birth to her in 1994\" (active voice), we would be making a conscious decision to highlight her mother's role in the moment. 205 COLLECTED WORKS \n This is often true in technical and scientific writing as well, which is why the passive voice is more common in STEM fields. In a lab report, for example, the experiment is more important than the researcher; for that reason, it's common to write in the passive voice. For example, \"Hydrochloric acid was then added\" (passive) is more common than \"I added hydrochloric acid.\" We also often use passive voice to avoid blaming others in a negative situation. In some cases, this is considered the most polite route. It may feel accusatory or aggressive to say, \"You did this assignment incorrectly\" (active). Instead, we might say, \"This assignment was done incorrectly.\" Again, both are correct, but we can make a writerly choice here to focus on the receiver of the action (the assignment) and in this case spare someone's feelings. However, be careful! The passive voice is sometimes used in this way to avoid taking responsibility. Newspapers famously use passive voice in a way that emphasizes the victims rather than the criminals. Politicians, corporations, and regular people also use the passive voice to duck blame or responsibility. Consider the following examples: Passive: She was assaulted at a party. Active: An unknown male assaulted her at a party. Passive: Authors of color have been historically marginalized by the publishing industry. Active: Historically, the publishing industry marginalized authors of color. Passive: Mistakes were made. Active: We made a mistake. (Or even more unthinkable: I made a mistake.) How does the active voice shift the focus of the sentence and potentially the cultural framing of sexual assault, racism, and other errors? You can see how the use of active or passive voice can be a political choice as well as a stylistic one. Passive voice isn't grammatically incorrect, and it has its place. The key (as with all elements of style) is to consider how its use impacts your writing. Notice it and make a choice about when to use it and when to cut it. You can check your own writing for passive voice. Does the \"doer\" of the action come after the action (the thing that was done)? Or does the doer disappear completely? If so, the sentence is likely in a passive voice. You can also look for this construction in your sentences: \n##### Point Of View: To \"I\" Or Not To \"I\" \n As a general rule, an \"I\" voice will give your writing a more personal and subjective feel. That's why a first-person perspective is common in memoirs and personal essays but rarely seen in STEM fields (although some scientific articles do refer to the researchers as \"we,\" which is a personal pronoun but somehow slightly less intimate than \"I\"). Academic writing in the humanities and social sciences is somewhere in between these two extremes--depending on the subject and context, a writer can make their own choice. Many well-known scholars in these fields use an \"I\" in their academic papers, especially if their connection to the subject \n### \"TO BE\" VERB (IS, ARE, WAS, ETC.) + \n### PAST PARTICIPLE (WALKED, TAKEN, \n### SEEN, ETC.) = PASSIVE VOICE \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 206 \n is important to understanding their perspective or point. Some authors use it just a little bit--maybe they open their article with a personal anecdote before moving into a more objective tone--while others use it throughout a piece of writing. It's worth noting that although writing without the \"I\" can be read as more objective, all writing is created by people with perspectives and stances. If I make an argument, it doesn't matter if I frame it with \"I argue\" or not; it's still my argument. From one perspective, then, using an \"I\" voice is simply more transparent about the subjectivity of the work. The \"I\" voice is slightly less formal, although it can still have a place in academic writing. It can also feel quite personal, depending on the subject.

This last point is often not fully appreciated, leading to errors. Be careful not to cavalierly add the cardinalities of nonmutually-exclusive sets! You'll end up double-counting items. \nSo we know that the number of possible license plates is equal to: \n the # of 7-character plates + the # of 6-character plates + the # of 5-character plates + * * * + the # of 1-character plates. \nVery well. We can now figure out each one separately. How do we know how many 7-character plates there are? Well, if every character must be either a letter or a digit, then we have 26 + 10 = 36 choices for each character. This implies 367 different possible 7-character license plates. The total number of plates is therefore: \n 367 + 36^6 + 36^5 + 36^4 + 36^3 + 36^2 + 36 = 80,603,140,212 plates \nwhich is about ten times the population of the earth, so I think we're safe for now. \n6.1. THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM 145 \nHere's an interesting thought experiment to test your intuition about numbers. Look at the above calculation, and ask yourself: \"what if the state of Virginia decided, for purposes of consistency, that all license plates _had_ to have the full 7 characters? Would that significantly reduce the total number of possible plates?\" My first inclination would be to say \"yes,\" because we're adding seven things in that equation, and if we mandated 7-character plates for everyone we'd eliminate 6 out of the 7. Surely we'd be in danger of running out of license plates to give to all the cars! But in fact the new total number of plates would turn out to be: \n 367 = 78,364,164,096 plates. \nWow. We've hardly lost _anything_ by scrapping all the less-than-7character plates. Turns out that in comparison with the 7-character plates, all the other lengths were a drop in the bucket. This is a powerful illustration of exponential growth. When you modify the exponent, going from something like 366 to 367 , you get astronomically larger very, very quickly. This is a good thing to know when all you want is an approximation of some quantity. How many passwords are possible in a system that mandates 6-10 characters per password? Well, you can pretty much ignore all the 6-9 character passwords and just count the 10-character passwords, because there are so many more of those. \nOne last tweak to the license plate example before we move on. Suppose (again, for the sake of consistency) that Virginia outlawed personalized plates and gave everyone a randomly generated 7-character plate. Furthermore, the last four characters of the plate had to be _digits_ instead of letters, so that something like \"RFP-6YQ7\" would be impossible. Now how many possible plates would there be? \nIn this case, not each of the k parts of n have an equal number of choices. n 1 through n 3 are still 36, but now n 4 through n 7 are just \n10. So this gives us: \n 36 x 36 x 36 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 466,560,000 plates \n146 CHAPTER 6. COUNTING \nor only about .006 times as many as before. Better stick with alphanumeric characters for all seven positions. \n**A simple trick** \nSometimes we have something difficult to count, but we can turn it around in terms of something much easier. Often this involves counting the _complement_ of something, then subtracting from the total. \nFor instance, suppose a certain website mandated that user passwords be between 6-10 characters in length -- every character being an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, digit, or special character (*, #, @, % or &) -- but it also required each password to have _at least one digit or special character._ How many passwords are possible? \nWithout the \"at least one digit or special character\" part, it's pretty easy: there are 26 + 26 + 10 + 5 = 67 different choices for each character, so we have \n 6710 + 67^9 + 67^8 + 67^7 + 67^6 = 1,850,456,557,795,600,384 strings. \nBut how do we handle the \"at least one\" part? \nOne way would be to list all the possible ways of having a password with at least one non-alpha character. The non-alpha could appear in the first position, or the second, or the third,... , or the tenth, but of course this only works for 10-digit passwords, and in any event it's not like the _other_ characters couldn't _also_ be non-alpha. It gets messy really fast. \nThere's a simple trick, though, once you realize that it's easy to count the passwords that _don't_ satisfy the extra constraint. Ask yourself this question: out of all the possible strings of 6-10 characters, how many of them _don't_ have at least one non-alpha character? (and are therefore illegal, according to the website rules?) \nIt turns out that's the same as asking \"how many strings are there with 6-10 alphabetic (only) characters?\" which is of course: \n 5210 + 52^9 + 52^8 + 52^7 + 52^6 = 147,389,519,403,536,384 (illegal) passwords. \n6.2. PERMUTATIONS 147 \nNow, all we have to do is subtract to get \ntotal # of strings - # of illegal passwords = # of legit passwords 1,850,456,557,795,600,384 - 147,389,519,403,536,384 = 1,708,735,865,301,022,720 \nlegitimate passwords. Looks like we don't lose much by requiring the non-alpha character. \nThe lesson learned is that if counting the elements in some set involves accounting for a lot of different sticky scenarios, it's worth a try to count the elements _not_ in the set instead, and see if that's easier. \n**6.2 Permutations** \nWhen we're counting things, we often run into permutations. A **permutation** of n distinct objects is an arrangement of them in a sequence. For instance, suppose all three Davies kids need to brush their teeth, but only one of them can use the sink at a time. What order will they brush in? One possibility is Lizzy, then T.J., then Johnny. Another possibility is T.J., then Lizzy, then Johnny. Another is Johnny, then Lizzy, then T.J. These are all different permutations of the Davies kids. Turns out there are six of them (find all 6 for yourself!) \nCounting the number of permutations is just a special application of the Fundamental Theorem of Counting. For the teeth brushing example, we have n = 3 different \"parts\" to the problem, each of which has ni choices to allocate to it. There are three different Davies kids who could brush their teeth first, so n 1 = 3. Once that child is chosen, there are then _two_ remaining children who could brush second, so n 2 = 2. Then, once we've selected a first-brusher and a second-brusher, there's only one remaining choice for the third-brusher, so n 3 = 1. This means the total number of possible brushing orders is: \n 3 x 2 x 1 = 6. \n148 CHAPTER 6. COUNTING \nThis pattern comes up so much that mathematicians have established a special notation for it: \n n x (n - 1) x (n - 2) x * * * x 1 = n! (\"n-factorial\") \nWe say there are \"3-factorial\" different brushing orders for the Davies kids. For our purposes the notion of factorial will only apply for integers, so there's no such thing as 23.46! or p!. (In advanced computer science applications, however, mathematicians sometimes do define factorial for non-integers.) We also define 0! to be 1, which might surprise you. \nThis comes up a heck of a lot. If I give you a jumbled set of letters to unscramble, like \"KRIBS\" (think of the Jumble(r)^ word game in the newspaper), how many different unscramblings are there? The answer is 5!, or 120, one of which is BRISK. Let's say I shuffle a deck of cards before playing War.^2 How many different games of War are there? The answer is 52!, since any of the cards in the deck might be shuffled on top, then any _but_ that top card could be second, then any _but_ those two could be third, _etc._ Ten packets arrive near-simultaneously at a network router. How many ways can they be queued up for transmission? 10! ways, just like a larger Davies family. \nThe factorial function grows really, really fast, by the way, even faster than exponential functions. A five letter word like \"BRISK\" has 120 permutations, but \"AMBIDEXTROUSLY\" has 87,178,291,200, ten times the population of the earth. The number of ways to shuffle a deck is \n80,658,175,170,944,942,408,940,349,866,698,506,766,127,860,028,660,283,290,685,487,972,352 \nso I don't think my boys will end up playing the same War game twice any time soon, nor my wife and I the same bridge hand. \n(^2) \"War\" is a mindless card game which involves no strategy or decisionmaking on the part of the players. Once you shuffle the initial deck, the entire outcome of the game is fixed. \n6.2. PERMUTATIONS 149 \n**Enumerating permutations** \nWe've discovered that there are 120 permutations of BRISK, but how would we go about listing them all? You can play around with the Davies kids and stumble upon all 6 permutations, but for larger numbers it's harder. We need a systematic way. \nTwo of the easiest ways to enumerate permutations involve recursion. Here's one: \n**Algorithm #1 for enumerating permutations** \n1. Begin with a set of n objects. \n a) If n = 1, there is only one permutation; namely, the object itself. b) Otherwise, remove one of the objects, and find the permutations of the remaining n - 1 objects. Then, insert the removed object at every possible position, creating another permutation each time. \nAs always with recursion, solving a bigger problem depends on solving smaller problems. Let's start with RISK. We've already discovered from the toothbrushing example that the permutations of ISK are ISK, IKS, SIK, SKI, KIS, and KSI. So to find the permutations of RISK, we insert an R into _each_ possible location for _each_ of these ISK-permutations. This gives us: \n R ISK I R SK IS R K ISK R R IKS I R KS IK R S IKS R R SIK * * * \n150 CHAPTER 6. COUNTING \nand so on. Once we have the RISK permutations, we can generate the BRISK permutations in the same way: \n B RISK R B ISK RI B SK RIS B K RISK B B IRSK I B RSK IR B SK IRS B K IRSK B B RSIK * * * \nAnother algorithm to achieve the same goal (though in a different order) is as follows: \n**Algorithm #2 for enumerating permutations** \n1. Begin with a set of n objects. \n a) If n = 1, there is only one permutation; namely, the object itself. b) Otherwise, remove each of the objects in turn, and prepend that object to the permutations of all the others, creating another permutation each time. \nI find this one a little easier to get my head around, but in the end it's personal preference. The permutations of BRISK are: \"B followed by all the permutations of RISK, plus R followed by all the permutations of BISK, plus I followed by all the permutations of BRSK, _etc._ \" So the first few permutations of a 4-letter word are: \n R I S K R I K S R S I K \n6.2. PERMUTATIONS 151 \n R S K I R K I S R K S I I R S K I R K S I S R K I S K R I K R S I K S R S R I K * * * \nThen, for the 5-letter word: \n B R I S K B R I K S B R S I K B R S K I B R K I S B R K S I B I R S K B I R K S * * * \n**Partial permutations** \nSometimes we want to count the permutations of a set, but only want to choose _some_ of the items each time, not all of them. For example, consider a golf tournament in which the top ten finishers (out of 45) all receive prize money, with the first place winner receiving the most, the second place finisher a lesser amount, and so on down to tenth place, who receives a nominal prize. How many different finishes are possible to the tournament? \nIn this case, we want to know how many different orderings of golfers there are, but it turns out that past tenth place, we don't care what order they finished in. All that matters is the first ten places. If the top ten are 1.Tiger, 2.Phil, 3.Lee, 4.Rory,... , and \n152 CHAPTER 6.

I've found that students go through a layered understanding of a prompt, at first understanding the basic concept and then looking more carefully at the prompt's specific requirements. But what makes their papers far more effective is if they can take ownership of the prompt--in other words, if they can consider a way of making it more than simply an assignment, making it an opportunity for them to address an issue they are passionate about to a specific audience. To help them develop this sense of audience and purpose, a discussion of exigency can be beneficial. This is one reason to talk about exigency at the beginning of the writing project. The discussion about it will differ depending on how narrowly their purpose and audience are being defined by the writing prompt, but either way, the beginning of the project is the first and probably best place to discuss exigency. \n#### WORKS CITED \n#### TEACHER RESOURCES FOR EXIGENCY: WHAT MAKES MY \n#### MESSAGE INDISPENSABLE TO MY READER BY QUENTIN VIEREGGE \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 114 \n It can also be helpful to discuss exigency when students are writing their introductory paragraphs or concluding paragraphs or as they are revising their drafts to craft a more compelling argument. These three points in the composition process are what I think of as global points, where students have an opportunity to look at the writing assignment holistically. As a reader--in and out of the classroom--the introduction and conclusion are often where I find exigent moments, and I tell students this, perhaps bringing in examples for them to review and discuss. As a writer, it's often in the middle or at the end of the writing process that I can better grasp the exigency of an argument for both myself and my readers, and this can be a point of discussion in class as well. As my chapter asserts, asking students to think in terms of author and reader personas may also help lead to discussions on exigency. Asking students to think of personas invites them to consider what agenda or values correspond with that persona and how those considerations can help writers establish connections with their readers. Finally, exigency isn't just connected to global issues like persona, audience, and purpose; it can also be thought of in terms of templates and well-worn rhetorical moves. Showing students rhetorical patterns connected to exigency, such as how writers explain a \"gap in the research,\" can help make it clear how they can articulate exigency at the sentence or passage level. \n##### DISCUSSION QUESTIONS \n1. Can you think of any other strategies for invoking exigency other than those     listed above? \n2. Have you ever struggled to think of a purpose behind your writing for a     particular paper? What did you do to resolve this problem? \n3. What nonfiction texts have you read that made you feel the text's subject     matter was absolutely essential to you? \n4. Find and read an academic article, political speech, or magazine article that     employs one of these strategies. Which strategy does it employ, and how     effective is the text at invoking exigency? \n5. What genres can you think of that are not mentioned in this article? In what     ways do authors typically use exigency in those genres?

What writers need is revision. Novice writers, experienced writers, all writers. Anyone interested in writing clearer, stronger, more persuasive and passionate prose, even those of us who are procrastinators panicking because we need to get a project finished or a paper written and it's 2:00 a.m. the night before our deadline--writers need revision because revision is not a discrete step. Revision is not the thing writers do when they're done writing. Revision is the writing. It's important to keep in mind I'm not talking about revision as proofreading or copyediting; no amount of grammatical, spelling, and style corrections transforms a piece of writing like focused attention to fundamental questions about purpose, evidence, and organization. That, to me, is revision: the heavy lifting of working through why I'm writing, who I'm writing for, and how I structure writing logically and effectively. My writing students are usually relieved to hear that published authors often find writing just as fraught as they do. Like college students, people paid to write--the journalists and the novelists and the technical writers--more often than not despair at the difference between what's in their heads and hearts and what ends up on the page the first time around. The professionals are just a little better at waiting things out, pushing through what Anne Lamott calls \"shitty first drafts\" and all the ones that follow, the revision of a tenth and a thirteenth and a twenty-third draft. In class, I show a YouTube video by Tim Weninger, a computer scientist and engineer at the University of Notre Dame. In the video, Weninger stitches together his revisions of a research paper. In my class, we play a game, guessing how many revisions Weninger did. The answer--463!--almost always surprises them. It still sometimes surprises me. And sure, some of those revisions are small, fiddly changes. But most of the time, even watching this quickly on classroom monitors, my students notice Weninger aims for the jugular in his writing. He's after a wholesale overhaul of his argument and of his larger work. \n#### REVISION IS WRITING \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 116 \n However, talking about revision in terms of numbers of drafts implies that all writing, all writers, and all revision work one way: hit your target draft number, like your daily Fitbit goals, and you magically get good writing. But more revision isn't necessarily better. Effective revising isn't making changes for the sake of change but instead making smarter changes. And professional writers--practiced writers--have this awareness even if they aren't aware of it. In Stephen King's memoir On Writing , he calls this instinct the ideal reader: an imagined person a writer knows and trusts but rewrites in response to, a kind of collaborative dance between writer and reader. To writers, the act of writing is an act of thinking. One writer in a landmark study comparing the habits of experienced writers to those of novices called their first drafts \"the kernel.\" If you're someone like me who is constantly struggling to demystify this complex cognitive thing we humans do, that metaphor of writing as a seed is revelatory. Revision is not a sign of weakness or inexperience or poor writing. It is the writing. The more writers push through chaos to get to the good stuff, the more they revise. The more writers revise, whether that be the keystrokes they sweat in front of a blinking, demanding cursor or the unofficial revising they do in our heads when they're showering or driving or running, the more the ideal reader becomes a part of their craft and muscle memory, of who they are as writers, so at some point, they may not know where the writing stops and the revision begins. Because writing and revision are impossible to untangle, revision is just as situational and interpretive as writing. In other words, writers interact with readers--writing and revision are social, responsive, and communal. Take Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech. King gave a rough draft of the most famous American speech of the twentieth century to eighteen hundred people crammed into a gymnasium in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, in November of \n1962. Seven months later, King gave another revision of the speech to a gathering of political and spiritual leaders, musicians, and activists in Detroit. In August of 1963, in front of the Lincoln Memorial, King riffed and reworked and rebuilt what he preached in Rocky Mount and Detroit, ad-libbing, deleting, and flipping lines. \"I Have a Dream\" is what Americans remember today, engraved in our collective memories, archives, and textbooks as a symbol of an entire era, but King's famous refrain singing his vision for a less racially divided country was not even part of his speech's official text that day. Was King writing a new speech? Was he done with the Rocky Mount or Detroit one? \"I Have a Dream\" was not one speech but many, written and rewritten. King was not content to let his words sit, but like any practiced writer working out his muscles, he revised and riffed, adapting it for new audiences and purposes. All this revision talk could lead to the counterargument that revision is a death spiral, a way of shoving off the potential critique of a finished draft forever. Tinkering is something we think of as quaint but not very efficient. Writers can always make the excuse that something is a work in progress, that they just don't have time for all this revision today. But this critique echoes the point that writing is social and responsive to its readers. Writing is almost always meant to be read and responded to, not hoarded away. A recent large-scale study on writing's impact on learning supports the idea that specific interventions in the writing process matter more in learning to write rather than how much \n#### REVISION: ALIVE AND KICKING \n 117 COLLECTED WORKS \nstudents are writing (Anderson et al.). Among these useful interventions are participation in a lively revision culture and an interactive and social writing process such as talking over drafts--soliciting feedback from instructors and classmates. Extending the modern definition of writing more broadly to composing in any medium, revision is as bound to writing as breathing is to living. If anything, humans are doing more writing and revision today. Sure, there are people who call themselves writers and mean that it is part of their formal job title. But then there are the greater numbers of us who are writers but don't label ourselves as such, the millions of us just noodling around on Facebook or Snapchat or Instagram. Facebook and Instagram have an edit feature on posts. Google Docs includes a revision history tool. When we send a text and our buzzy little e-devices kick in with autocorrect, changing Linkin Park to Kinky Park, we compensate with frantic asterisks. We edit our comments or return to clarify them; we cannot resist. Revision as writing is an idea that we should not abandon or trash--and it may not even be possible to do so if we tried. The original chapter, Strong Writing and Writers Don't Need Revision by Laura Giovanelli, is from Bad Ideas about Writing \n**1.** One of the headings in this essay is a common saying in the field of rhetoric     and composition: \"revision is writing\" (or sometimes \"writing is revision\").     What does this mean? What does this perspective suggest about the     writing process or how experienced writers write? \n**2.** What revision strategies have you used in the past? What has been     effective for you? \n**3.** What gets in the way of revision? What makes this a difficult process to     undertake? \n**4.** How does the story about Dr. King change your understanding or     perspective on MLK and his fame as one of history's greatest public     speakers? \n**5.** Consider the story about Dr. King's revision process as he wrote \"I Have a     Dream.\" How is the revision process different in public speaking than in     writing a paper? What could transfer, and what could not? \n#### DISCUSSION QUESTIONS \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 118 \n**1.** Read Mike Birbiglia's article \"6 Tips for Getting Your Solo Play to     Broadway.\" Although his tone is humorous--Birbiglia is a comedian--he has     some interesting things to say about the revision process in developing his     stand-up special.         How does Birbiglia's process compare or contrast with           what we know of Dr. King's?         Do a little research on other stand-up comedians'           processes. What surprises you about what you learn?           What can you take away? \n**2.** Choose one revision strategy that's new to you (either from discussion in     class or from your own research). Try it out with your own draft. Write a     paragraph reflecting on the process. What surprised you? What did you     learn through this process? In what ways was it helpful, and in what ways     was it not? Will you use it again? \n#### ACTIVITIES \n119 COLLECTED WORKS \n**1.** For more about the relationships between revision, writing experience, and     writing processes, see Alice Horning and Anne Becker's _Revision: History,_     _Theory, and Practice_ (Parlor Press) and Linda Adler-Kassner and Elizabeth     Wardle's _Naming What We Know: Threshold Concepts of Writing Studies_ (Utah     State University Press), specifically Doug Downs's chapter, \"Revision Is     Central to Developing Writing.\" \n**2.** Just a handful of many important studies that have helped writing scholars     better understand what's going on when writers revise are Nancy     Sommers's \"Revision Strategies of Student Writers and Experienced     Writers\"; Lester Faigley and Stephen Witte's \"Analyzing Revision\"; Mina     Shaughnessy's _Errors and Expectations: A Guide for the Teacher of Basic_     _Writing_ (Oxford University Press); and Paul Anderson, Chris Anson, Charles     Paine, and Robert M.

Heavy lines indicate edges that have been (irrevocably) added to the set. \n5.2. TREES 111 \nyou think that the shortest path between any two nodes would land right on this Prim network? Yet if you compare Figure 5.14 with Figure 5.13 you'll see that the quickest way from Bordeaux to Strasbourg is through Marseille, not Vichy. \nSo we end up with the remarkable fact that the shortest route between two points has nothing whatsoever to do with the shortest _total_ distance between _all_ points. Who knew? \n**5.2 Trees** \nA tree is really nothing but a simplification of a graph. There are two kinds of trees in the world: free trees, and rooted trees.^4 \n**Free trees** \nA **free tree** is just a connected graph with no cycles. Every node is reachable from the others, and there's only one way to get anywhere. Take a look at Figure 5.15. It looks just like a graph (and it is) but unlike the WWII France graph, it's more skeletal. This is because in some sense, a free tree doesn't contain anything \"extra.\" \nIf you have a free tree, the following interesting facts are true: \n1. There's exactly one path between any two nodes. (Check it!) \n2. If you remove any edge, the graph becomes disconnected.     (Try it!) \n3. If you add any new edge, you end up adding a cycle. (Try it!) \n4. If there are n nodes, there are n - 1 edges. (Think about it!) \nSo basically, if your goal is connecting all the nodes, and you have a free tree, you're all set. Adding anything is redundant, and taking away anything breaks it. \n(^4) There appears to be no consensus as to which of these concepts is the most basic. Some authors refer to a free tree simply as a \"tree\" -- as though this were the \"normal\" kind of tree -- and use the term rooted tree for the other kind. Other authors do the opposite. To avoid confusion, I'll try to always use the full term (although I admit I'm one who considers rooted trees to be the more important, default concept). \n112 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \n C \n B D \n E \n A \n F \n Figure 5.15: A free tree. \nIf this reminds you of Prim's algorithm, it should. Prim's algorithm produced exactly this: a _free tree_ connecting all the nodes -- and specifically the free tree with shortest possible total length. Go back and look at the final frame of Figure 5.14 and convince yourself that the darkened edges form a free tree. \nFor this reason, the algorithm is often called **Prim's minimal spanning tree algorithm**. A \"spanning tree\" just means \"a free tree that spans (connects) all the graph's nodes.\" \nKeep in mind that there are many free trees one can make with the same set of vertices. For instance, if you remove the edge from A to F, and add one from anything else to F, you have a different free tree. \n**Rooted trees** \nNow a **rooted tree** is the same thing as a free tree, except that we elevate one node to become the **root**. It turns out this makes all the difference. Suppose we chose A as the root of Figure 5.15. Then we would have the rooted tree in the left half of Figure 5.16. The A vertex has been positioned at the top, and everything else is flowing under it. I think of it as reaching into the free tree, carefully grasping a node, and then lifting up your hand so the rest of the free tree dangles from there. Had we chosen (say) C as the root \n5.2. TREES 113 \ninstead, we would have a different rooted tree, depicted in the right half of the figure. Both of these rooted trees have all the same edges as the free tree did: B is connected to both A and C, F is connected only to A, _etc._ The only difference is which node is designated the root. \n A \n F B \n C \n D E \n C \n B \n A \n F \n D E \nFigure 5.16: Two different rooted trees with the same vertices and edges. \nUp to now we've said that the spatial positioning on graphs is irrelevant. But this changes a bit with rooted trees. Vertical positioning is our only way of showing which nodes are \"above\" others, and the word \"above\" does indeed have meaning here: it means closer to the root. The altitude of a node shows how many steps it is away from the root. In the right rooted tree, nodes B, D, and E are all one step away from the root (C), while node F is three steps away. \nThe key aspect to rooted trees -- which is both their greatest advantage and greatest limitation -- is that _every node has one and only one path to the root._ This behavior is inherited from free trees: as we noted, every node has only one path to every other. \nTrees have a myriad of applications. Think of the files and folders on your hard drive: at the top is the root of the filesystem (perhaps \"/\" on Linux/Mac or \"C:\\\\\" on Windows) and underneath that are named folders. Each folder can contain files as well as other named folders, and so on down the hierarchy. The result is that each file has one, and only one, distinct path to it from the top of the filesystem. The file can be stored, and later retrieved, in exactly one way. \n114 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \nAn \"org chart\" is like this: the CEO is at the top, then underneath her are the VP's, the Directors, the Managers, and finally the rankand-file employees. So is a military organization: the Commander in Chief directs generals, who command colonels, who command majors, who command captains, who command lieutenants, who command sergeants, who command privates. \nThe human body is even a rooted tree of sorts: it contains skeletal, cardiovascular, digestive, and other systems, each of which is comprised of organs, then tissues, then cells, molecules, and atoms. In fact, anything that has this sort of part-whole containment hierarchy is just asking to be represented as a tree. \nIn computer programming, the applications are too numerous to name. Compilers scan code and build a \"parse tree\" of its underlying meaning. HTML is a way of structuring plain text into a tree-like hierarchy of displayable elements. AI chess programs build trees representing their possible future moves and their opponent's probable responses, in order to \"see many moves ahead\" and evaluate their best options. Object-oriented designs involve \"inheritance hierarchies\" of classes, each one specialized from a specific other. _Etc._ Other than a simple sequence (like an array), trees are probably the most common data structure in all of computer science. \n**Rooted tree terminology** \nRooted trees carry with them a number of terms. I'll use the tree on the left side of Figure 5.16 as an illustration of each: \n**root.** The node at the top of the tree, which is A in our example. Note that unlike trees in the real world, computer science trees have their root at the top and grow down. Every tree has a root except the **empty tree** , which is the \"tree\" that has no nodes at all in it.

By playing on the audience's feelings, writers can increase the impact of their arguments. There are two especially effective techniques for cultivating pathos: \n**1.** **_Make the audience aware of the issue's relevance to them specifically_** --\"How     would you feel if this happened to you? What are we to do about this issue?\" \n**2.** **_Tell stories._** A story about one person or one community can have a deeper     impact than broad, impersonal data or abstract, hypothetical statements. Consider the difference between \"About 1.5 million pets are euthanized each year\" and \"Scooter, an energetic and loving former service dog with curly brown hair like a Brillo pad, was put down yesterday.\" Both are impactful, but the latter is more memorable and more specific. Pathos is ubiquitous in our current journalistic practices because people are more likely to act (or at least consume media) when they feel emotionally moved. Consider, as an example, the outpouring of support for detained immigrants in June 2018, reacting to the Trump administration's controversial family separation policy. As stories and images surfaced, millions of dollars were raised in a matter of days on the premise of pathos, resulting in the temporary suspension of that policy. Your argument wouldn't be complete without an appeal to ethos. Cultivating ethos refers to the means by which you demonstrate your authority or expertise on a topic. You'll have to show your audience that you're trustworthy if they are going to buy your argument. There are a handful of ways to demonstrate ethos: Although your lived experience might not set hard-and-fast rules about the world, it is worth noting that you may be an expert on certain facets of your life. For instance, a student who has played rugby for fifteen years of their life is in many ways an authority on the sport. Professional achievements demonstrate ethos by revealing status in a certain field or discipline. The common expression is \"Stand on the shoulders of giants.\" You can develop ethos by pointing to other people with authority and saying, \"Look, this smart/ experienced/qualified/important person agrees with me.\" A common misconception is that ethos corresponds with \"ethics.\" However, you can remember that ethos is about credibility because it shares a root with \"authority.\" \n#### ETHOS \n##### By personal experience \n##### By education or other certifications \n##### By citing other experts \n 45 COLLECTED WORKS \n \"Good\" argumentation depends largely on your place in time, space, and culture. Different cultures throughout the world value the elements of argumentation differently, and argument has different purposes in different contexts. The content of your argument and your strategies for delivering it will change in every unique rhetorical situation. Continuing from logos, pathos, and ethos, the notion of kairos speaks to this concern. To put it in plain language, kairos is the force that determines what will be the best argumentative approach in the moment in which you're arguing; it is closely aligned with rhetorical occasion. According to rhetoricians, the characteristics of the kairos determine the balance and application of logos, pathos, and ethos. Moreover, your sociohistorical context will bear on what you can assume of your audience. What can you take for granted that your audience knows and believes? The \"common sense\" that your audience relies on is always changing: common sense in the US in 1950 was much different from common sense in the US in 1920 or common sense in the US in 2022. You can make assumptions about your audience's interests, values, and background knowledge, but only with careful consideration of the time and place in which you are arguing. As an example, let's consider the principle of logical noncontradiction. Put simply, this means that for an argument to be valid, its logical premises must not contradict each other: if A = B, then B = A. If I said that a dog is a mammal and a mammal is an animal, but a dog is not an animal, I would be contradicting myself. Or \"No one drives on I-84; there's too much traffic.\" This statement contradicts itself, which makes it humorous to us. However, this principle of noncontradiction is not universal. Our understanding of cause and effect and logical consistency is defined by the millennia of knowledge that has been produced before us, and some cultures value the contradiction rather than perceive it as invalid. This is not to say that either way of seeing the world is more or less accurate but rather to emphasize that your methods of argumentation depend tremendously on sociohistorical context.

A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 48 \n###### CHAPTER 7. \n## SITUATING ARGUMENTS \n###### KRISTY KELLY \n Arguments are all about context, and they're designed for and by people. People have conflicting motivations, complicated views, wide varieties of values, and ideological commitments, and they carry assumptions, both examined and unexamined, that shape their receptivity toward a particular argument. If you are going to persuade anyone, you need to understand as much as you can about those values, motivations, and assumptions before you can get them to listen to you, let alone act based on your argument. Let's look at an example. Let's say you've just moved into an apartment with three new roommates who've already lived together for a year before you moved in. Since you're new to the living situation, you'd want to take some time to understand their preferences, routines, and opinions before you started making changes around the apartment. You certainly wouldn't get a cat before realizing that one of your new roommates has a cat allergy--or if you did, it would be pretty rude. But more subtly than that, you'd need to understand the internal dynamics of the roommate situation before you influence it yourself. Take a smaller example. Maybe your roommates have a friend that comes over frequently but acts really obnoxious in your opinion. They're loud, they leave a mess, and they rely on your roommates to pay for food and drinks without making a contribution themselves. You want to convince your roommates to stop inviting this person over so frequently, and you start the conversation by saying, \"Hey, that one friend of yours is really disruptive and rude every time they come over. Can you stop bringing them here, or at least run it past me before they come over?\" You think you're being reasonable with this request, but one of your roommates gives you a look of shock and says, \"What are you talking about? That person is the best\"; the other roommate goes silent; and the third roommate storms out of the room. You're baffled. Your roommates become awkward around you until you finally pull the first roommate aside and ask, \"What's the deal? Why did everyone react like that?\" You then learn that this friend helped your roommate who stormed out of the room through an incredibly tough time back in high school, to the point that they may never have even made it to college without this friend. The friend then went through some really big struggles themselves and had to start some medications that make their behavior really uneven--causing them to act a little strange when they visit the apartment. You feel a little bit sheepish about your attitude from before, realizing that this all makes a lot of sense now that you know the full context. 49 A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT \nLike we said before: rhetoric is all about **context.** You can't have a decent conversation, let alone persuade someone, if you don't understand the various motivations, connections, and implicit values driving the situation you're stepping into. So that's what a good rhetorician does--they try to understand the internal dynamics of the audience she hopes to influence. You probably understand this on an instinctual level. We use this kind of sensitivity to navigate complicated situations with our friends, families, and coworkers all the time. But you may not have applied this sort of thinking to the writing you've done in academic settings. This book is here to help you situate your arguments in academic conversations, just as you would situate your arguments in social settings where you know all the stakeholders involved. \"So wait--you're saying I have to understand a person's deepest values and moral commitments before I can persuade them? How can I do that if I don't even know the people I'm talking to?\" That may sound like mind reading at best and manipulation at worst. But it's really about respect and ethical argumentation. The best rhetorician listens before she argues. According to Krista Ratcliffe, listening is one of the most important elements of successful communication, particularly when it takes place across cultures or in contexts when the participants might be at odds with one another (196). Actually _listening_ to someone else is hard work. So often we're just looking for ways to shut the other person down or bolster our own viewpoints or we're merely waiting for our turn to speak. But good rhetoric doesn't work that way because it's all about taking the time to understand the audience's values and shape the argument around them rather than merely learning enough about a group of people in order to influence their views. Rhetoricians use the term _presuppositions_ to describe those tacit values that lay the foundations for arguments. Understanding the audience's presuppositions is a prerequisite to effective argumentation. Mark Longaker and Jeffrey Walker call presuppositions \"the system of ideas--the ways of thinking--that the speaker and audience share, making them a community (more or less)\" (14). Presuppositions involve what both the speaker and audience \"love, hate, fear, admire, yearn for; their sense of what is true...what they know as 'fact,' their sense of the structure of reality\"--in other words, the network of beliefs that determines how they see the world (14). Note that the speaker and audience _share_ these values in this definition. It's not enough to pander to your audience, pretending that you believe in something you don't in order to get them to see your way of thinking. This is about arguing from the same playing field so that everyone shares the same rules and sense of what they're aiming for. Here's a classic example: in _A Modest Proposal,_ Jonathan Swift expresses his outrage about the inhumane treatment of impoverished Irish by making a satirical argument for his fellow citizens to enact a program to eat the poor's newborn babies (and worse) to solve the country's economic problems. Swift makes an exaggerated, ironic claim to highlight the folly of his audience's biases and beliefs, and by making his outrageous proposal seem calmly logical, well cited, and persuasive, he beguiles his audience into confronting their own hypocrisy. Not eating babies is one of the audience's latent beliefs about what is right, and Swift uses that shared value to force his audience to see how their _other_ latent beliefs (in this case, tacit acceptance of inhumane treatment of their country's less well-off) are not only wrong but immoral. That's a rather extreme example, but we can see how it applies to the roommate example as well. The roommates share a respect for the history that shapes the visiting friend's behavior, operating on the implicit assumption that it's worth tolerating some of the friend's less-thanideal qualities in recognition of that history. This reveals some of the group's deeper beliefs A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 50 \n about the reciprocal nature of friendship and the importance of mutual support. You likely believe in those ideals, too, but your initial argument wasn't effective because it didn't recognize that those beliefs were in play. For Longaker and Walker, \"Presuppositions determine not only what the speaker means and what the audience understands; they also determine both the speaker's and the audience's understanding of the occasion\" (14). Now that you understand what's really at issue regarding the visiting friend's behavior, you're in a much better position to make arguments that resonate with the presuppositions you all share about friendship. In the quote above, Longaker and Walker say that the speaker and audience become a \"community\" when they're engaging with arguments based on shared beliefs. It turns out that we're all members of beliefs-based communities and that we're shifting between these groups all the time in our day-to-day lives </passage>"}], "prediction": "<tools>\n[{'arguments': <args-dict>, 'name': <function-name>}]\n</tools>\nFor each extraction function call return a json object with function name and arguments followed by a <tool_call> tag with the following schema:\n<tool_call>\n{'arguments': <args-dict>, 'name': <function-name>}\n</tool_call>\nHere are the extracted queries for the passage:\n1.

But that wouldn't change the order and have K visited earlier. \nFinally, it's worth mentioning that all of these traversal methods make elegant use of **recursion**. Recursion is a way of taking a large problem and breaking it up into similar, but smaller, subproblems. Then, each of those subproblems can be attacked in the same way as you attacked the larger problem: by breaking _them_ up into subproblems. All you need is a rule for eventually stopping the \"breaking up\" process by actually doing something. \nEvery time one of these traversal processes treats a left or right child as a subtree, they are \"recursing\" by re-initiating the whole traversal process on a smaller tree. Pre-order traversal, for instance, \n5.2.

Once that's finished, wake me up so I can similarly start it with my right child.\" Recursion is a very common and useful way to solve certain complex problems, and trees are rife with opportunities. \n**Sizes of binary trees** \nBinary trees can be any ragged old shape, like our Figure 5.17 example. Sometimes, though, we want to talk about binary trees with a more regular shape, that satisfy certain conditions. In particular, we'll talk about three special kinds: \n**full binary tree.** A full binary tree is one in which every node (except the leaves) has two children. Put another way, every node has either two children or none: no stringiness allowed. Figure 5.17 is not full, but it would be if we added the three blank nodes in Figure 5.21. By the way, it isn't always possible to have a full binary tree with a particular number of nodes. For instance, a binary tree with two nodes, can't be full, since it inevitably will have a root with only one child. \n122 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \n G \n K \n D \n O \n I \n M \n C E \n H \n A B \n F N \n L \n Figure 5.21: A full binary tree. \n**complete binary tree.** A complete binary tree is one in which every level has all possible nodes present, except perhaps for the deepest level, which is filled all the way from the left. Figure 5.21 is not complete, but it would be if we fixed it up as in Figure 5.22. \n G \n K \n D \n O \n I \n M \n C E \n H \n A \n L \n B \n F N \n Figure 5.22: A complete binary tree. \n Unlike full binary trees, it is always possible to have a complete binary tree no matter how many nodes it contains. You just keep filling in from left to right, level after level. \n**perfect binary tree.** Our last special type has a rather audacious title, but a \"perfect\" tree is simply one that is exactly bal\n5.2. TREES 123 \n anced: every level is completely filled. Figure 5.22 is not perfect, but it would be if we either added nodes to fill out level 4, or deleted the unfinished part of level 3 (as in Figure 5.23.) \n G \n K \n D \n O \n M \n C E \n H \n A \n I \n B \n F N \n Figure 5.23: A \"perfect\" binary tree. \n Perfect binary trees obviously have the strictest size restrictions. It's only possible, in fact, to have perfect binary trees with 2 h+1^ - 1 nodes, if h is the height of the tree. So there are perfect binary trees with 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, ... nodes, but none in between. In each such tree, 2 h^ of the nodes (almost exactly half) are leaves. \nNow as we'll see, binary trees can possess some pretty amazing powers if the nodes within them are organized in certain ways. Specifically, a binary search tree and a heap are two special kinds of binary trees that conform to specific constraints. In both cases, what makes them so powerful is the rate at which a tree grows as nodes are added to it. \nSuppose we have a perfect binary tree. To make it concrete, let's say it has height 3, which would give it 1+2+4+8=15 nodes, 8 of which are leaves. Now what happens if you increase the height of this tree to 4? If it's still a \"perfect\" tree, you will have added 16 more nodes (all leaves). Thus you have _doubled_ the number of leaves by simply adding one more level. This cascades the more levels you add. A tree of height 5 doubles the number of leaves again (to 32), and height 6 doubles it again (to 64). \n124 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \nIf this doesn't seem amazing to you, it's probably because you don't fully appreciate how quickly this kind of **exponential growth** can accumulate. Suppose you had a perfect binary tree of height 30 -- certainly not an awe-inspiring figure. One could imagine it fitting on a piece of paper...height-wise, that is. But run the numbers and you'll discover that such a tree would have over half a billion leaves, more than one for every person in the United States. Increase the tree's height to a mere 34 -- just 4 additional levels -- and suddenly you have over 8 billion leaves, easily greater than the population of planet Earth. \nThe power of exponential growth is only _fully_ reached when the binary tree is perfect, since a tree with some \"missing\" internal nodes does not carry the maximum capacity that it's capable of. It's got some holes in it. Still, as long as the tree is fairly bushy ( _i.e._ , it's not horribly lopsided in just a few areas) the enormous growth predicted for perfect trees is still approximately the case. \nThe reason this is called \"exponential\" growth is that the quantity we're varying -- the height -- appears as an _exponent_ in the number of leaves, which is 2 h. Every time we add just _one_ level, we _double_ the number of leaves. \nSo the number of leaves (call it l) is 2 h, if h is the height of the tree. Flipping this around, we say that h = lg(l). The function \"lg\" is a logarithm, specifically a logarithm with base-2. This is what computer scientists often use, rather than a base of 10 (which is written \"log\") or a base of e (which is written \"ln\"). Since 2 h grows very, very quickly, it follows that lg(l) grows very, very slowly. After our tree reaches a few million nodes, we can add more and more nodes without growing the height of the tree significantly at all. \nThe takeaway message here is simply that an incredibly large number of nodes can be accommodated in a tree with a very modest height. This makes it possible to, among other things, search a huge amount of information astonishingly quickly...provided the tree's contents are arranged properly. \n5.2. TREES 125 \n**Binary search trees (BST's)** \nOkay, then let's talk about how to arrange those contents. A **binary search tree** (BST) is any binary tree that satisfies one additional property: _every node is \"greater than\" all of the nodes in its left subtree, and \"less than (or equal to)\" all of the nodes in its right subtree._ We'll call this **the BST property**. The phrases \"greater than\" and \"less than\" are in quotes here because their meaning is somewhat flexible, depending on what we're storing in the tree. If we're storing numbers, we'll use numerical order. If we're storing names, we'll use alphabetical order. Whatever it is we're storing, we simply need a way to compare two nodes to determine which one \"goes before\" the other. \nAn example of a BST containing people is given in Figure 5.24. Imagine that each of these nodes contains a good deal of information about a particular person -- an employee record, medical history, account information, what have you. The nodes themselves are indexed by the person's name, and the nodes are organized according to the BST rule. Mitch comes after Ben/Jessica/Jim and before Randi/Owen/Molly/Xander in alphabetical order, and this ordering relationship between parents and children repeats itself all the way down the tree. (Check it!) \nBe careful to observe that the ordering rule applies between a node and the _entire_ contents of its subtrees, not merely to its immediate children. This is a rookie mistake that you want to avoid. Your first inclincation, when glancing at Figure 5.25, below, is to judge it a BST. It is _not_ a binary search tree, however! Jessica is to the left of Mitch, as she should be, and Nancy is to the right of Jessica, as she should be. It seems to check out. But the problem is that Nancy is a descendant of Mitch's _left_ subtree, whereas she must properly be placed somewhere in his _right_ subtree. And yes, this matters. So be sure to check your BST's all the way up and down. \n**The power of BST's** \nAll right, so what's all the buzz about BST's, anyway? The key insight is to realize that if you're looking for a node, all you have to do is start at the root and go _the height of the tree down_ making \n126 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \n Mitch \n Jessica \n Ben Jim \n Randi \n Owen \n Molly \n Xander \n Figure 5.24: A binary search tree. \none comparison at each level. Let's say we're searching Figure 5.24 for Molly. By looking at Mitch (the root), we know right away that Molly must be in the right subtree, not the left, because she comes _after_ Mitch in alphabetical order. So we look at Randi. This time, we find that Molly comes _before_ Randi, so she must be somewhere in Randi's left branch. Owen sends us left again, at which point we find Molly. \nWith a tree this size, it doesn't seem that amazing. But suppose its height were 10. This would mean about 2000 nodes in the tree -- customers, users, friends, whatever. With a BST, you'd only have to examine _ten_ of those 2000 nodes to find whatever you're looking for, whereas if the nodes were just in an ordinary list, you'd have to compare against 1000 or so of them before you stumbled on the one you were looking for. And as the size of the tree grows, this discrepancy grows (much) larger. If you wanted to find a single person's records in New York City, would you rather search 7 million names, or 24 names?? Because that's the difference you're looking at. \nIt seems almost too good to be true. How is such a speedup pos\n5.2. TREES 127 \n Mitch \n Jessica \n Ben Nancy \n Randi \n Owen \n Molly \n Xander \nFigure 5.25: **NOT** a binary search tree, though it looks like one at first glance. (Notice Nancy and Mitch) \nsible? The trick is to realize that with every node you look at, you effectively eliminate _half of the remaining tree_ from consideration. For instance, if we're looking for Molly, we can disregard Mitch's entire left half without even looking at it, then the same for Randi's entire right half. If you discard half of something, then half of the remaining half, then half again, it doesn't take you long before you've eliminated almost every false lead. \nThere's a formal way to describe this speedup, called \"Big-O notation.\" The subtleties are a bit complex, but the basic idea is this. When we say that an algorithm is \"O(n)\" (pronounced \"oh-of-n\"), it means that the time it takes to execute the algorithm is _proportional to the number of nodes._ This doesn't imply any specific number of milliseconds or anything -- that is highly dependent on the type of computer hardware, you have, the programming language, and a myriad of other things. But what we _can_ say about an O(n) algorithm is that if you double the number of nodes, you're going to approximately double the running time. If you quadruple the number of nodes, you're going to quadruple the running time. This is what you'd expect. \n128 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \nSearching for \"Molly\" in a simple unsorted list of names is an O(n) prospect. If there's a thousand nodes in the list, on average you'll find Molly after scanning through 500 of them. (You might get lucky and find Molly at the beginning, but then of course you might get really unlucky and not find her until the end. This averages out to about half the size of the list in the normal case.) If there's a _million_ nodes, however, it'll take you 500,000 traversals on average before finding Molly. Ten times as many nodes means ten times as long to find Molly, and a thousand times as many means a thousand times as long.

Very specific, higher stakes, more complex answers As you hone your path of inquiry, you may need to zoom in or out in terms of scope: depending on your rhetorical situation, you will need different degrees of focus. Just like narration, research writing benefits from a careful consideration of scope. Often, a narrower scope is easier to work with than a broader scope--you will be able to write more and write better if your question asks for more complex thinking. It's important to be flexible throughout your research project. Be prepared to pivot topics, adjust your research question, change your opinions, and confront unanticipated challenges. As you build a working knowledge of your topic, you might complicate or narrow your working questions. Gradually, try to articulate a research question (or combination of questions). Remember to be flexible as you research though: you might need to pivot, adjust, refocus, or replace your research question as you learn more. Consider this imaginary case study as an example of this process: Ahmed began his project by identifying the following areas of interest: racism in the US, technology in medicine and health care, and independent filmmaking. After doing some freewriting and preliminary research on each, he decided he wanted to learn more about racially motivated police violence. He developed working questions: \n#### WORKING QUESTIONS \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 146 \n Are police officers likely to make judgments about citizens based on their race?  Have police forces instituted policies to avoid racism?  Who is most vulnerable to police violence?  Why does it seem like police officers target people of color? Who is responsible for overseeing the police? He realized that he needed to narrow his focus to develop a more viable path of inquiry, eventually ending up with the following research question:  Over the last thirty years, what populations are most likely to experience police violence in the US? However, after completing more research, Ahmed discovered that his answers came pretty readily: young Black men are significantly more vulnerable to be victims of police violence. He realized that he was not really saying anything new, so he had to tweak his path of inquiry. Ahmed did some more freewriting and dug around to find a source that disagreed with him or added a new layer to his answers. He discovered eventually that there are a handful of police organizations that have made genuine efforts to confront racism in their practices. Despite the widespread and normalized violence enacted against people of color, these groups were working against racial violence. He reoriented his research question to be the following:  Have antiracist police trainings and strategies been effective in reducing individual or institutional racism over the last thirty years?

What was the last thing that pulled you down     an internet rabbit hole? \n**2.** How would you adapt the following question so that it leads to further     inquiry and analysis rather than the straightforward reporting of facts?     \"How can the average consumer reduce their carbon emissions?\" \n#### DISCUSSION QUESTIONS \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 148 \n**1.** Brainstorming. Create a catalog of topics you are personally curious     about--things that you want to learn more about. These don't have to be     revolutionary things right away; it's more important that they're     meaningful to you.        **a.** First, choose three of the following broad topic           headings: politics, science and technology, food, sports,           music and art, other cultures and nations, social justice,           the environment and sustainability, health and disease,           business and economy, education. On your first sheet           of a three-column paper, write those three topic           headings. **b.** Next, underneath each topic heading, write bulleted lists of as many subtopics or related ideas that come to mind that interest you. (Try not to censor yourself here--the idea is to generate a large number of bullet points. To some extent, this is an exercise in free association: What are the first things that come to mind when you think of each topic?) Spend ten to fifteen minutes on your lists.        **c.** Read over your lists, making note especially of items           that surprised you. Choose the three items from the           full page that most interest you. You can choose one           from each column, three from the same, or any           combination of lists, so long as you have three items           that you care about. \n**2.** Idea generation: Internet stumbling. In addition to its status as an ever-     expanding repository of knowledge and in addition to its contributions to     global human connection, the internet is also an exceptional free-     association machine.

Spend fifteen to twenty minutes clicking around on the internet,        using one of the following media for guidance, and jot down every        potential topic that piques your interest.           **a.** Wikipedia: Go to the Wikipedia homepage and check              out the \"featured article\" of the day, or choose              \"Random Article\" from the sidebar on the far left. Click \n#### ACTIVITIES \n149 COLLECTED WORKS \n any of the hyperlinks in the article to redirect to a different page. Bounce from article to article, keeping track of the titles of pages and sections that catch your eye. b. An Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, or Twitter feed: Flow through one or more social media feeds, using links, geotags, user handles, and hashtags to encounter a variety of posts. c. After stumbling, review the list you've made of potentially interesting topics. Are you already familiar with any of them? Which surprised you? Are there any relationships or intersections worth exploring further? From these topics and subtopics, try to articulate a viable and interesting research question that speaks to your curiosity. \n**3.** Moving from topics to questions: Small group activity. Begin to develop     working and research questions by collaborating with your classmates to     explore different curiosities.        **a.** Divide your paper into three columns. Write three           potential topics as headings, one in each column. **b.** Sit in a circle with your groupmates; each student should pass their three-column paper one position clockwise. For five minutes, each student will freewrite questions about each topic. No question is too big or small, too simple or complex. Try to generate as many questions as you possibly can. Then rotate your papers another step--repeat until you have your original sheet of paper back.        **c.** Review the questions your groupmates compiled on           your sheet. Have they offered anything that surprises           you--issues you haven't thought of, relationships           between questions, recurring themes or patterns of           interest, or foci that might yield interesting answers? \n**4.** Moving from topics to questions: Whole class gallery walk.

Such consternation! Educators are fond of research papers because they require you to find your own sources, confront conflicting evidence, and synthesize diverse information and ideas--all skills required in any professional leadership role. Research papers also allow students to pursue their own topic of interest; your professors have to assume that you are genuinely interested in at least some major part of the course. The open-endedness of research papers sets you up to do your best work as a self-motivated scholar. This chapter is about secondary sources: what they are, where to find them, and how to choose them. For example, let's think about the distinction between primary and secondary sources. Primary sources are original documents, data, or images: the law code of the Le Dynasty in Vietnam, the letters of Kurt Vonnegut, data gathered from an experiment on color perception, an interview, or Farm Service Administration photographs from the 1930s. Secondary sources are produced by analyzing primary sources. They include news articles, scholarly articles, reviews of films or art exhibitions, documentary films, and other pieces that have some descriptive or analytical purpose. Some things may be primary sources in one context but secondary sources in another. For example, if you're using news articles to inform an analysis of a historical event, they're serving as secondary sources. If you're counting the number of times a particular newspaper reported on different types of events, then the news articles are serving as primary sources because they're more akin to raw data. You've probably heard by now that if you cite Wikipedia as an authoritative source, the wrath of your instructor shall be visited upon you. Why is it that even the most informative Wikipedia articles are still often considered illegitimate? And what are good sources to use? The table below summarizes the types of secondary sources in four tiers. All sources have their legitimate uses, but the top-tier ones are preferable for citation in an academic context. \n#### AH, THE RESEARCH PAPER \n#### SOME SOURCES ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 154 \n Table 20.1 Analyzing the quality of secondary sources \n##### Tier Type Content Uses How to find them \n##### Tier \n##### I \n Peer-reviewed academic publications Rigorous research and analysis Provide strong evidence for claims and references to other high-quality sources Google Scholar, library catalogs, and academic article databases \n##### Tier \n##### II \n Reports, articles, and books from credible nonacademic sources Well-researched and even-handed descriptions of an event or state of the world Initial research on events or trends not yet analyzed in the academic literature; may reference important Tier 1 sources Websites of relevant agencies, Google searches using *.gov or *.org sites, academic article databases \n##### Tier \n##### III \n Short pieces from newspapers or credible websites Simple reporting of events, research findings, or policy changes Often point to useful Tier 2 or Tier 1 sources; may provide a factoid or two not found anywhere else Strategic Google searches or article databases, including newspapers and magazines \n##### Tier \n##### IV \n Agenda-driven or uncertain pieces Mostly opinion, varying in thoughtfulness and credibility May represent a particular position within a debate; more often provide keywords and clues about higher-quality sources Nonspecific Google </passage>"}], "prediction": "<tools>\n[{\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"ExpertSourceExtractor\", \"description\": \"Extracts a list of secondary sources that are relevant to the research project, including peer-reviewed academic publications, reports, articles, and books from credible nonacademic sources, and short pieces from newspapers or credible websites.\", \"parameters\": {\"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": {\"secondary_sources\": {\"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"secondary_sources\"]}}}]\n</tools>\nFor each extraction function call return a json object with function name and arguments followed by a <tool_call> tag with the following schema:\n<tool_call>\n{'arguments': <args-dict>, 'name': <function-name>}\n</tool_call>", "pred_tool_call": null, "true_tool_call": null, "metrics": {"valid_json": false, "name_match": false, "args_exact_match": false, "args_field_precision": 0.0, "args_field_recall": 0.0, "args_field_f1": 0.0}}

Thus, you can accept the findings as legitimate and just focus on the passages that explain the findings and their significance in plainer language. If you have a really good article that's a few years old, you can use article databases to find newer articles that cited it in their own literature reviews. That immediately tells you which ones are on the same topic and offer newer findings. On the other hand, if your first source is recent, the literature review section will describe the other papers in the same line of research. You can look them up directly. Students sometimes grumble when they're ordered to use scholarly articles in their research. It seems a lot easier to just Google some terms and find stuff that way. However, academic articles are the most efficient resource out there. They are vetted by experts and structured specifically to help readers zero in on the most important passages. Your campus library pays big money to subscribe to databases for Tier 1 articles. Some are general purpose databases that include the most prominent journals across disciplines, and some are specific to a particular discipline. Often they have the full text of the articles right there for you to save or print. We won't go over particular databases here because every campus has different offerings. If you haven't already attended a workshop on using the resources provided \n##### 1. Find them quickly \n##### 2. Use the abstracts \n##### 3. Read strategically \n##### 4. Don't sweat the technical stuff \n##### 5. Use one article to find others \n#### FINDING TIER 1 SOURCES \n##### ARTICLE DATABASES \n 159 COLLECTED WORKS \n by your library, you should. A one-hour workshop will save you many, many hours in the future. If there aren't any workshops, you can always seek advice from librarians and other library staff on the best databases for your topic. Many libraries also have online research guides that point you to the best databases for the specific discipline and, perhaps, the specific course. Librarians are eager to help you succeed with your research--it's their job and they love it!--so don't be shy about asking. Another popular article database is Google Scholar. It looks like a regular Google search, and it aspires to include the vast majority of published scholarship. Google doesn't share a list of which journals they include or how Google Scholar works, which limits its utility for scholars. Also, because it's so wide ranging, it can be harder to find the most appropriate sources. However, if you want to cast a wide net, it's a very useful tool. Here are three tips for using Google Scholar effectively: If you just put in \"crime,\" for example, Google Scholar will return all sorts of stuff from sociology, psychology, geography, and history. If your paper is on crime in French literature, your best sources may be buried under thousands of papers from other disciplines. A set of search terms like \"crime French literature modern\" will get you to relevant sources much faster. When you click on links to articles in Google Scholar, you may end up on a publisher's site that tells you that you can download the article for $20 or $30. Don't do it! You probably have access to virtually all the published academic literature through your library resources. Write down the key information (authors' names, title, journal title, volume, issue number, year, page numbers) and go find the article through your library website. If you don't have immediate full-text access, you may be able to get it through an interlibrary loan. If you get one great hit on Google Scholar, you can quickly see a list of other papers that cited it. For example, the search terms \"crime economics\" yielded this hit for a 1988 paper that appeared in a journal called Kyklos: Fig 20.1 Google Scholar The year 1988 is quite a while ago; for a social science paper, you probably want more recent sources. You can see that, according to Google, this paper was cited by 392 other sources. You can click on the \"Cited by 392\" to see that list. You can even search within that list of 392 if you're trying to narrow down the topic. For example, you could search the term \"cities\" to see which of those 392 articles are most likely to be about the economic impact of crime on cities. \n##### 1. Add your field (economics, psychology, French, etc.) as one of your keywords \n##### 2. Don't ever pay for an article \n##### 3. Use the \"cited by\" feature \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 160 \n You'll probably engage the subscription article databases at different points in the process. For example, imagine you've been assigned a research paper that can focus on any topic relevant to the course. Imagine further that you don't have a clue about where to start and aren't entirely sure what counts as an appropriate topic in this discipline. A great approach is to find the top journals in the specific field of your course and browse through recent issues to see what people are publishing on. For example, when I assign an open-topic research paper in my Introduction to Sociology course, I suggest that students looking for a topic browse recent issues of Social Problems or the American Journal of Sociology and find an article that looks interesting. They'll have a topic and--booyah!--their first source. An instructor of a class on kinesiology might recommend browsing Human Movement Science, the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, or Perceptual and Motor Skills. When you have a topic and are looking for a set of sources, your biggest challenge is finding the right keywords. You'll never find the right sources without them. You'll obviously start with words and phrases from the assignment prompt, but you can't stop there. As explained above, lower-tier sources (such as Wikipedia) or the top-tier sources you already have are great for identifying alternative keywords, and librarians and other library staff are also well practiced at finding new approaches to try. Librarians can also point you to the best databases for your topic as well. As you assess your evidence and further develop your thesis through the writing process, you may need to seek additional sources. For example, imagine you're writing a paper about the added risks adolescents face when they have experienced their parents' divorce. As you synthesize the evidence about negative impacts, you begin to wonder if scholars have documented some positive impacts as well. Thus you delve back into the literature to look for more articles, find some more concepts and keywords (such as \"resiliency\"), assess new evidence, and revise your thinking to account for these broader perspectives. Your instructor may have asked you to turn in a bibliography weeks before the final paper draft. You can check with your professor, but he or she is probably perfectly fine with you seeking additional sources as your thinking evolves. That's how scholars write. Finding good sources is a much more creative task than it seems on the face of it. It's an extended problem-solving exercise, an iterative cycle of questions and answers. Go ahead and use Wikipedia to get broadly informed if you want. It won't corrupt your brain. But use it, and all other sources, strategically. You should eventually arrive at a core set of Tier 1 sources that will enable you to make a well-informed and thoughtful argument in support of your thesis. It's also a good sign when you find yourself deciding that some of the first sources you found are no longer relevant to your thesis; that likely means that you have revised and specified your thinking and are well on your way to constructing the kind of self-driven in-depth analysis that your professor is looking for. The original chapter, Secondary Sources in Their Natural Habitat by Amy Guptill, is from Writing in College: From Competence to Excellence \n#### LIBRARY RESEARCH AS PROBLEM-SOLVING \n 161 COLLECTED WORKS \n**1.** Tier 1 sources are the most credible source for an academic audience. Are     there situations where Tier 2, 3, or 4 sources would work as evidence for     an argument? \n**2.** This chapter gives Wikipedia as an example of a Tier 4 source because its     information is from an unknown source. What sources--or types of     sources--could be considered \"agenda-driven\" Tier 4 sources? \n**3.** If you are unfamiliar with a source or author, how can you determine if it is     agenda driven or otherwise not credible? \n**4.** Is there ever a case where a Tier 4 source could be useful in an academic     paper? \n**5.** Which tiers of sources are the easiest to find? Which ones are the hardest?     Why? \n**1.** Choose a research topic, enter it into Google and then into Google Scholar,     and compare your results. Some topics you could try: college athletes and     academics, antibiotic resistance, Ptolemaic dynasty. \n**2.** Using various databases, find one source in each of the four tiers for a     particular topic. \n**3.** Find a Tier 3 article that summarizes and cites a Tier 1 academic paper.     Click through to the original article. How is the same information     presented differently in the two sources? \n**4.** Enter a topic into a general subscription database that has both scholarly     and nonscholarly sources (such as Academic Search Complete or Academic     OneFile); browse the first few hits and classify each one as scholarly or not     scholarly. Look at the structure of the piece to make your determination. \n#### DISCUSSION QUESTIONS \n#### ACTIVITIES \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 162 \n**1.** Google provides some great tips for getting the most out of Google     Scholar. \n**2.** This resource from Bowling Green State University explains how searching     subject headings in a database (compared to keywords) can more quickly     bring you to relevant sources. \n**3.** Explore your university's library website!

Even the most basic projects required sifting through card catalogs, scrolling through endless microfiche and microfilm slides, and dedicating hours to scouring the stacks of different libraries. But now, there is no dearth of information; indeed, the internet has connected us to more information than any single person could process in an entire lifetime. Once you have determined which conversation you want to join, it's time to begin finding sources. Inquiry-based research requires many encounters with a diversity of sources, so the internet serves us well by enabling faster, more expansive access. But while the internet makes it much easier to find those sources, it comes with its own host of challenges. The biggest problems with primarily internet-based research can be boiled down to two issues: \n**1.** There is too much out there to sift through everything that might be relevant. \n**2.** There is an increased prominence of unreliable, biased, or simply untrue     information. This chapter focuses on developing strategies and techniques to make your research and research writing processes more efficient, reliable, and meaningful, especially when considering the unique difficulties presented by research writing in the digital age. Specifically, you will learn strategies for discovering, evaluating, and integrating sources. \n##### Research Methods: Discovering Sources \n Let's bust a myth before going any further: there is no such thing as a \"good\" source. What makes a source \"good\" is actually determined by your purpose: how you use the source in your text is most important to determining its value. If you plan to present something as \n#### TECHNIQUES \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 164 \n truth--like a fact or statistic--it is wise to use a peer-reviewed journal article (one that has been evaluated by a community of scholars). But if you're trying to demonstrate a perspective or give evidence, you may not find what you need in a journal. Table 21.1 An example of position that might need more than scholarly resources \n##### Your \n##### position \n##### A supporting fact \n##### (something you present as factual ) \n##### An example that demonstrates your \n##### position \n##### (something that you present as a \n##### perspective ) \n Women are unfairly criticized on social media.

As you discover useful sources, try to expand your usual research process by experimenting with the techniques and resources included in this chapter. The first and most important determining factor of your research is where you choose to begin. Although there are a great number of credible and useful texts available across different search platforms, I generally encourage my students to begin with two resources: \n**1.** Their college or university's library and its website \n**2.** Google Scholar These resources are not bulletproof, and you can't always find what you need through them. However, their general search functionality and the databases from which they draw tend to be more reliable, specific, and professional.

Doing outside research enriches the conversation in your paper, builds your fluency and confidence in the subject, and can bolster (or challenge) your own argument. As a writer, it's important to give credit to the original author whenever you use outside words or ideas. This is true in every academic discipline, and it's true in less formal contexts, as well. Imagine that you're scrolling through Instagram or TikTok (or whatever cool new social media platform has been invented since these words were written--the challenge of writing in such a fast-moving world!). If an influencer uses someone else's audio clip or artwork, it's considered basic internet courtesy to tag the original source to give them credit. In fact, if reposters don't do this, the original creator might publicly complain and accuse the \"borrower\" of stealing their work. Why do they care? Why does it matter to the creators or artists if someone reposts their artwork? Some people would argue that reposting helps spread the art around, so it's actually good for the original artist. That makes sense, to a point--but how does that argument hold up if the original creator isn't tagged or attributed in any way? Your answers to those questions are probably similar to the reasons why citation matters in academia. Researchers and authors are generally glad for others to reference their work--after all, they published it rather than keeping it in a private diary--but they want credit for the work they've done. Using someone else's words or ideas without citing them--or citing them incorrectly--can feel like stealing. The original author (or content creator) only benefits from the \"repost\" if you cite their work, leading others back to the original source. In that sense, citation is an ethical issue: giving credit where credit is due. Don't get me wrong though. Citation isn't a purely selfless act. It also benefits you, the writer! Citing your sources builds your credibility as a speaker on the subject because it shows your audience that you have done your research. It gives your statements more weight by indicating that they came from a reliable source. (You should, of course, be using reliable sources; chapters 22 and 23 on evaluating sources can help you determine whether a source is trustworthy.) \n#### CITATION IS GOOD FOR CREATORS \n#### CITATION IS GOOD FOR YOU TOO \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 242 \n For example, if you write that there will be 25 million centenarians (people who are 100 years old or more) in the year 2100, your reader will immediately want to know how you reached that conclusion. \"Based on what?!\" they'll ask. If the statistic seems to come out of nowhere, your audience could be distracted by the statement. They might even wonder if your arguments or conclusions are well founded, since you seem to be pulling numbers from thin air. However, if you cite your source--and it's a reliable, reputable source--you will instantly build credibility with your audience. They will be more willing to accept the initial statistic and then listen to your argument on its own merits. You will show them that you have some knowledge on the topic and that your knowledge comes from authoritative sources. Consider the following examples. Which is the most credible? The answer is clear: it's the one with the specifics and the citation. There will be even more elderly people in the future. There will be more than 25 million centenarians in the year 2100. Although the United Nations predicts that there will be 25 million centenarians by 2100, other demographers have found that population transitions and global events make it harder to pinpoint. A truer estimate is somewhere between 13 and 50 million (Robine and Cubaynes 60). As you can see, citing your sources also pushes you to be more specific. In this case, I saw the \"25 million\" statistic in the article's abstract, but on closer reading, I found that the authors' research actually suggested a range. I had to read the article carefully to understand that point though--another key part of building your knowledge, fluency, and credibility. Now, depending on your purposes, you may wish for a simpler version of the information. In many cases though, the more complex (and research-supported) version works better--it's potentially more accurate and, honestly, more interesting. In every discipline, you need to cite outside words and ideas. If you're not sure whether to cite something or not, err on the side of caution and cite it! It's better to overcite than undercite. For example, you should always cite the following:  Quotes  Paraphrases  Statistics  Charts or other graphics  Images  Arguments or ideas  Original phrases \n#### WHAT TO CITE \n 243 COLLECTED WORKS \n Depending on your discipline, you might use some of these examples more than others. In the humanities, for example, quotes are an important form of evidence: how someone says something can be just as important as what they say. For that reason, quoting the original source is common in literature, history, and philosophy classes. In other fields, the data are the most important point. In your science and social science classes, then, you will probably rely mostly on statistics and paraphrases as supporting evidence. It's rare to see a direct quote in an engineering paper. Knowing what kinds of sources to use--and how to use them--is part of the learning you will do in your discipline. You can read example papers and articles in a particular field or ask your instructor for guidance. What's consistent across all of these disciplines, though, is the need to cite the information. If you are using outside words or ideas, you need to essentially tell your audience, \"Hey! This information came from another source. Here's how you can find it.\" You will do this by including two forms of citation for every outside source: (1) an in-text citation and (2) an end citation. \n##### In-text Citation \n The details of how to create citations will vary depending on what kind of class you're taking. In writing and other humanities courses, we often use MLA citation (which stands for Modern Language Association); psychology and other social sciences often use APA citation (American Psychological Association). Other citation styles include IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), CSE (Council of Science Editors), CMS ( Chicago Manual of Style ), and more. Ask your instructor which citation style you should use for each class. In all cases, though, you need to include an in-text citation (which will match up with an end citation--more on those in a minute). An in-text citation is like a signpost that says, \"This! This right here! I didn't make this up--it's from an outside, credible source.\" In MLA, this in-text citation is a parenthetical citation after the quote or paraphrase, like this: (Robine and Cubaynes 62). It typically includes the author's name and the page number that the information came from (if there is one). APA is similar but includes the author's last name and the year of publication, like this: (Garcia, 2008). In both cases, the reader will easily find more information on the alphabetized works cited or references page by looking in the G section for Garcia. Other citation styles may use a number enclosed in brackets [1] or a superscript number1 to indicate that this information is from an outside source. In those cases, the number 1 will lead the reader to the first entry on the references list, where they will find a full citation. What if there's no author listed? What if there are seventeen authors listed? The answer varies depending on your citation style--so you will have to do your own footwork to find the answer. The OWL at Purdue is an excellent resource for citation questions, whether you're working with MLA, APA, IEEE, or something else. \n#### HOW TO CITE \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 244 \n##### End Citations \n Similar to in-text citations, end citations vary quite a bit. In fact, even the name of the citations section varies: in MLA, we call this the \"works cited,\" while in other disciplines, you may see it being called \"references\" or \"bibliography.\" In all cases, though, the end citations provide significant details about the sources you cited in the text. As a general rule, your in-text citations and end citations should match up. If you have six sources listed on your works cited page but only one cited in the body of your paper, there's a problem. In this example, your reader will get the sense that you did some research--but they won't be able to tell which information came from which source or even which ideas were yours and which belong to someone else. To avoid this problem, cite as you go--don't wait until the end and try to insert citations throughout the paper. That's a recipe for disaster. While the specifics about formatting may vary, most end citations will include some or all of the following things in the order required by the style guide:  Author(s)  Title of the article  Title of the source it came from (e.g., the journal, newspaper, or website title)  Date of publication  Volume and issue number (for journals)  DOI or URL (for digital sources) Again, though, there will be variation across citation styles. Some elements may be italicized or in quote marks, for example, or the authors' names may use only first initials. While these differences and details may seem arbitrary, they're important because they tell careful readers what they're looking at. In MLA, the article title is in quotes and the journal title is italicized; if these markers are reversed, it's a little harder to figure out what we're looking at. Attention to detail here can also add to the professionalism and credibility of your paper as a whole. Here's the good news: you never have to memorize how to create perfect MLA or APA citations. What you do need to know, though, is that your sources have to be cited--and that you can find and apply the appropriate rules for your project whether it's in communications, psychology, or civil engineering. \n##### A Word About Citation Tools \n Real talk: how do you actually create citations for your papers? Chances are, you use a citation maker of some kind--either online, in the research database you are using, or embedded in Word or Google Docs. Instructors have different opinions about these, but I would argue that they're a valuable tool. Use what you have! A warning, though: citation tools are a useful starting point, but they're not perfect. The free online versions are especially prone to missing style updates or incorrect formatting. The 245 COLLECTED WORKS \ndatabase and word processor versions (as well as citation managers like Zotero and EndNote) tend to be better, but again--not perfect. They're only as good as the information they pick up from the source (or that you input, depending on the tool). For that reason, you should consider the citations that are churned out by these tools to be a rough draft. You will need to check them to ensure that they are accurate and consistent. \n**1.** Why is attribution important to online content creators? Do you know of     any examples where a creator was not given appropriate credit? How did it     impact them? \n**2.** Do you think that attribution/citation norms are shifting and changing in     the digital world?

Talk through it as a class. Which pieces of information were hard to find?     Where are there points of confusion? How did this process help you better     understand the citation requirements? How might this help you in the     future, even if you continue to use citation tools? \n**3.** Use a citation maker of your choice to create an end citation for a source.

Do you worry excessively about writing assignments? Do they make you feel uneasy or agitated? Do you have negative feelings about certain types of writing? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you might be dealing with writing anxiety. Writing anxiety simply means that a writer is experiencing negative feelings about a given writing task. Writing anxiety is often more about the audience and/or purpose for a given writing task than it is about the mere act of writing itself. Say you just bought a new pair of headphones. You brought them home, removed all the packaging, and connected them to your phone, and they're \n#### WHAT IS WRITING ANXIETY AND HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE IT? \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 24 \n amazing! So you decide to visit the company website, and you write a stellar review of the product, giving it a five-star rating and including descriptive details about the headphones' comfortable fit, excellent sound quality, ability to cancel outside noise, and reasonable price. Now let's say that the next day in biology class, your instructor covers the topic of biomes, and you learn about animal habitats and biodiversity and the interrelation and interdependence of species within biomes. You find it fascinating and can't wait to learn more. But then something terrible happens. Your instructor assigns a term project on the subject. As your instructor begins to describe the length and other specifications for the report, complete with formatting guidelines, citation requirements, and a bibliography at the end, your palms start to sweat, your stomach feels uneasy, and you begin to have trouble focusing on anything else your instructor has to say. You're experiencing writing anxiety. Writing anxiety is the condition of feeling uneasy about writing, and writer's block is what you experience when you can't manage to put words on the page. But these conditions aren't about the act of writing. Just yesterday, you wrote a great review for those cool new headphones. So why do you suddenly feel paralyzed by the thought of writing the biology essay? Let's consider some possible causes. The causes of writing anxiety are many. Here are just a few:  Inexperience with the type of writing task  Previous negative experiences with writing (e.g., someone, maybe a teacher, has given you negative feedback or said negative things about your writing)  Negative feelings about writing (e.g., \"I'm not a good writer,\" \"I hate writing\")  Immediate deadline  Distant deadline  Lack of interest in the topic  Personal problems or life events Your level of experience may explain why you felt comfortable writing the headphone review yet broke out in a sweat at the thought of the biology paper. If you've never written anything similar to a specific assignment, maybe you're unsure about whether you can meet the assignment requirements or the teacher's expectations. Or maybe the last time you turned in a written report for school you received negative feedback or a bad grade from the teacher. Maybe you procrastinated most of the term, and now the paper is due next week, and you feel overwhelmed. Or maybe it's the second week of the term and the deadline seems so far away that you're not motivated to write. Knowing the cause of your writing anxiety can help you move beyond it and get writing, even if you can't completely eliminate the problem. If the topic doesn't interest you or if you're having \n#### WHAT CAUSES WRITING ANXIETY? \n 25 COLLECTED WORKS \n problems at home, those probably aren't issues that will just disappear, but if you try some of the following strategies, I think you'll find that you can at least move forward with even the most anxiety inducing of writing assignments. There are a number of strategies that you can draw on to help you move past the feeling of being lost or stuck. Consider the following strategies to help you start writing again. \n##### Just Start Writing \n It might sound like it's oversimplifying the matter, but it's true. Half the battle is to just start writing. Try some strategies like freewriting or note-taking to get your writing muscles moving. Give yourself permission to write badly at this stage! Bruce Ballenger, a writer and professor of English at Boise State, explains why writing badly is an important part of the writing process: \"Giving myself permission to write badly makes it much more likely that I will write what I don't expect to write, and from those surprises will come some of my best writing. Writing badly is also a convenient alternative to staring off into space and waiting for inspiration.\" Sometimes the biggest problem writers have with getting started is that they feel like the writing needs to be good or well organized, or they feel like they need to start at the beginning. None of that is true. All you need to do is start. Have you ever seen a potter make a clay pot? Before a potter can start shaping or throwing a pot, they have to bring the big wet blob of clay and slap it down on the table. It's heavy and wet and messy, but it's the essential raw material. No clay? No pot. \"Bad writing\" is a lot like that. You have to dump all the words and ideas onto the table. Just get them out. Only then do you have the raw material you need to start shaping the words into something beautiful and lasting. You can wait until the revision stages to worry about shaping your writing to be its best. For now, just get the ideas on the table. \n##### Create Smaller Tasks And Short-Term Goals \n One of the biggest barriers to writing can be that the task just seems too large, and perhaps the due date is weeks away. Each of these conditions can contribute to feelings of being overwhelmed or to the tendency to procrastinate. But the remedy is simple and will help you keep writing something each week toward your deadline and toward the finished product: divide larger writing tasks into smaller, more manageable tasks, and set intermediate deadlines. The process that the authors used for writing this text provides a good example. As authors, we had to divide the text into sections, but we also had to plan the process for a first draft, peer reviews, and revisions, along with adding images, links, and other resources, not to mention the final publication of the text online. Had we not divided up the larger tasks into smaller ones and set short-term goals and deadlines, the process of writing the text would have been overwhelming. We didn't meet every single intermediate deadline right on time, but they helped move us along and helped us meet the most important deadline--the final one--with a complete text that was ready to publish on schedule. Imagine that you have a term paper that's assigned during Week 1 of an eleven-week term, and it's due during finals week. Make a list of all the tasks you can think of that need to be \n#### STRATEGIES FOR OVERCOMING OR MANAGING WRITING ANXIETY \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 26 \n completed, from beginning to end, to accomplish all that the assignment requires. List the tasks, and assign yourself due dates for each task. Consider taking it a step further, and create a task table that allows you to include a column for additional notes. Here's an example: Table 4.1 An example of a writing schedule. A modifiable and accessible download can be accessed here. \n##### Task \n##### Complete \n##### by \n##### Notes \n##### Brainstorm topics and select a topic. Wed., Week 2^ Notes: \n##### Do some preliminary research on the web to learn \n##### about the topic. \n Wed., Week 3 Notes: \n##### Develop list of search terms for some more focused \n##### research. \n Fri., Week 3 Notes: search terms.^ Ask instructor to look over my \n##### Spend some time at the library searching library \n##### holdings, databases, more focused research on the \n##### web. \n Mon., Week 4 Notes: time and transportation.^ Plan ahead to make sure I have \n##### Read sources and take notes.

Sometimes talking about your ideas is the best way to flesh them out and get more ideas flowing. Write down notes during or just after your conversation. 27 COLLECTED WORKS \n Classmates are a great resource because they're studying the same subjects as you and working on the same assignments. Talk to them often, and form study groups. Ask people to look at your ideas or writing and to give you feedback. Set goals and hold each other accountable for meeting deadlines (a little friendly competition can be motivating!). Talk to other potential readers. Ask them what they would expect from this type of writing. Meet with a tutor in your campus writing center. Be sure to come to the appointment prepared with a printed copy of the assignment and a short list of what you want to work on, along with a printed copy of your essay. \n##### Embrace Reality \n Don't imagine the situation of your writing assignment to be any better or worse than it really is. There are some important truths for you to recognize:  Focus on what you do best rather than fretting about your perceived weaknesses.  Acknowledge that writing can be difficult and that all you need to do is do your best.  Recognize what might be new or unfamiliar about the type of writing that you're doing.  Remember that you're a student and that you're supposed to be experiencing things that are new and unfamiliar (new formats, new audiences, new subject matter, new processes, new approaches, etc.).  Repeat the mantra \"It doesn't have to be perfect; it just has to be done .\" \n##### Seek Out Experts \n If you can, find more experienced writers (especially related to the type of writing that you're doing) and ask them questions. Sometimes, this might just mean a friend or family member who's already taken a couple of years of college courses. Maybe it's a fellow student who has already taken the class you're in now. Also, the tutors in your college writing center can be a big help at any stage in the writing process. Give them a call and make an appointment. And don't forget the expert you see all the time throughout any class that you take: your instructor. Ask your instructor for suggestions. That's what they're there for. Another way to learn from the experience of others is to look at examples of other pieces of writing of the type that you're working on. How is this piece organized? Does it make use of source material? What sort of tone does it use? If you don't know where to find examples, ask your instructor. If they don't have them at the ready, they'll likely be able to give you some suggestions about where to find some.

Thus, you can accept the findings as legitimate and just focus on the passages that explain the findings and their significance in plainer language. If you have a really good article that's a few years old, you can use article databases to find newer articles that cited it in their own literature reviews. That immediately tells you which ones are on the same topic and offer newer findings. On the other hand, if your first source is recent, the literature review section will describe the other papers in the same line of research. You can look them up directly. Students sometimes grumble when they're ordered to use scholarly articles in their research. It seems a lot easier to just Google some terms and find stuff that way. However, academic articles are the most efficient resource out there. They are vetted by experts and structured specifically to help readers zero in on the most important passages. Your campus library pays big money to subscribe to databases for Tier 1 articles. Some are general purpose databases that include the most prominent journals across disciplines, and some are specific to a particular discipline. Often they have the full text of the articles right there for you to save or print. We won't go over particular databases here because every campus has different offerings. If you haven't already attended a workshop on using the resources provided \n##### 1. Find them quickly \n##### 2. Use the abstracts \n##### 3. Read strategically \n##### 4. Don't sweat the technical stuff \n##### 5. Use one article to find others \n#### FINDING TIER 1 SOURCES \n##### ARTICLE DATABASES \n 159 COLLECTED WORKS \n by your library, you should. A one-hour workshop will save you many, many hours in the future. If there aren't any workshops, you can always seek advice from librarians and other library staff on the best databases for your topic. Many libraries also have online research guides that point you to the best databases for the specific discipline and, perhaps, the specific course. Librarians are eager to help you succeed with your research--it's their job and they love it!--so don't be shy about asking. Another popular article database is Google Scholar. It looks like a regular Google search, and it aspires to include the vast majority of published scholarship. Google doesn't share a list of which journals they include or how Google Scholar works, which limits its utility for scholars. Also, because it's so wide ranging, it can be harder to find the most appropriate sources. However, if you want to cast a wide net, it's a very useful tool. Here are three tips for using Google Scholar effectively: If you just put in \"crime,\" for example, Google Scholar will return all sorts of stuff from sociology, psychology, geography, and history. If your paper is on crime in French literature, your best sources may be buried under thousands of papers from other disciplines. A set of search terms like \"crime French literature modern\" will get you to relevant sources much faster. When you click on links to articles in Google Scholar, you may end up on a publisher's site that tells you that you can download the article for $20 or $30. Don't do it! You probably have access to virtually all the published academic literature through your library resources. Write down the key information (authors' names, title, journal title, volume, issue number, year, page numbers) and go find the article through your library website. If you don't have immediate full-text access, you may be able to get it through an interlibrary loan. If you get one great hit on Google Scholar, you can quickly see a list of other papers that cited it. For example, the search terms \"crime economics\" yielded this hit for a 1988 paper that appeared in a journal called Kyklos: Fig 20.1 Google Scholar The year 1988 is quite a while ago; for a social science paper, you probably want more recent sources. You can see that, according to Google, this paper was cited by 392 other sources. You can click on the \"Cited by 392\" to see that list. You can even search within that list of 392 if you're trying to narrow down the topic. For example, you could search the term \"cities\" to see which of those 392 articles are most likely to be about the economic impact of crime on cities. \n##### 1. Add your field (economics, psychology, French, etc.) as one of your keywords \n##### 2. Don't ever pay for an article \n##### 3. Use the \"cited by\" feature \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 160 \n You'll probably engage the subscription article databases at different points in the process. For example, imagine you've been assigned a research paper that can focus on any topic relevant to the course. Imagine further that you don't have a clue about where to start and aren't entirely sure what counts as an appropriate topic in this discipline. A great approach is to find the top journals in the specific field of your course and browse through recent issues to see what people are publishing on. For example, when I assign an open-topic research paper in my Introduction to Sociology course, I suggest that students looking for a topic browse recent issues of Social Problems or the American Journal of Sociology and find an article that looks interesting. They'll have a topic and--booyah!--their first source. An instructor of a class on kinesiology might recommend browsing Human Movement Science, the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, or Perceptual and Motor Skills. When you have a topic and are looking for a set of sources, your biggest challenge is finding the right keywords. You'll never find the right sources without them. You'll obviously start with words and phrases from the assignment prompt, but you can't stop there. As explained above, lower-tier sources (such as Wikipedia) or the top-tier sources you already have are great for identifying alternative keywords, and librarians and other library staff are also well practiced at finding new approaches to try. Librarians can also point you to the best databases for your topic as well. As you assess your evidence and further develop your thesis through the writing process, you may need to seek additional sources. For example, imagine you're writing a paper about the added risks adolescents face when they have experienced their parents' divorce. As you synthesize the evidence about negative impacts, you begin to wonder if scholars have documented some positive impacts as well. Thus you delve back into the literature to look for more articles, find some more concepts and keywords (such as \"resiliency\"), assess new evidence, and revise your thinking to account for these broader perspectives. Your instructor may have asked you to turn in a bibliography weeks before the final paper draft. You can check with your professor, but he or she is probably perfectly fine with you seeking additional sources as your thinking evolves. That's how scholars write. Finding good sources is a much more creative task than it seems on the face of it. It's an extended problem-solving exercise, an iterative cycle of questions and answers. Go ahead and use Wikipedia to get broadly informed if you want. It won't corrupt your brain. But use it, and all other sources, strategically. You should eventually arrive at a core set of Tier 1 sources that will enable you to make a well-informed and thoughtful argument in support of your thesis. It's also a good sign when you find yourself deciding that some of the first sources you found are no longer relevant to your thesis; that likely means that you have revised and specified your thinking and are well on your way to constructing the kind of self-driven in-depth analysis that your professor is looking for.

Even the most basic projects required sifting through card catalogs, scrolling through endless microfiche and microfilm slides, and dedicating hours to scouring the stacks of different libraries. But now, there is no dearth of information; indeed, the internet has connected us to more information than any single person could process in an entire lifetime. Once you have determined which conversation you want to join, it's time to begin finding sources. Inquiry-based research requires many encounters with a diversity of sources, so the internet serves us well by enabling faster, more expansive access. But while the internet makes it much easier to find those sources, it comes with its own host of challenges. The biggest problems with primarily internet-based research can be boiled down to two issues: \n**1.** There is too much out there to sift through everything that might be relevant. \n**2.** There is an increased prominence of unreliable, biased, or simply untrue     information. This chapter focuses on developing strategies and techniques to make your research and research writing processes more efficient, reliable, and meaningful, especially when considering the unique difficulties presented by research writing in the digital age. Specifically, you will learn strategies for discovering, evaluating, and integrating sources. \n##### Research Methods: Discovering Sources \n Let's bust a myth before going any further: there is no such thing as a \"good\" source. What makes a source \"good\" is actually determined by your purpose: how you use the source in your text is most important to determining its value. If you plan to present something as \n#### TECHNIQUES \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 164 \n truth--like a fact or statistic--it is wise to use a peer-reviewed journal article (one that has been evaluated by a community of scholars). But if you're trying to demonstrate a perspective or give evidence, you may not find what you need in a journal.

The first and most important determining factor of your research is where you choose to begin. Although there are a great number of credible and useful texts available across different search platforms, I generally encourage my students to begin with two resources: \n**1.** Their college or university's library and its website \n**2.** Google Scholar These resources are not bulletproof, and you can't always find what you need through them. However, their general search functionality and the databases from which they draw tend to be more reliable, specific, and professional.

You might first think that we'd add the two probabilities for the two events and be done with it, but a glance at the diagram tells you this means trouble. Pr(U ) is .4, and Pr(R) is .7. Even if we weren't very smart, we'd know something was wrong as soon as we added .4 + .7 = 1. 1 to get a probability of over 1 and violate rule 1. But we are smart, and looking at the diagram it's easy to see what happened: _we double-counted Kelly's probability._ Kelly was a member of both groups, so her .2 got counted in there twice. Now you can see the rationale for rule 3. To get Pr(U  R) we add Pr(U ) and Pr(R), but then we have to subtract back out the part we double-counted. And what did we double-count? Precisely the intersection U  R. \nAs a second example, suppose we want the probability of an underage or female winner? Pr(U ) = .4, and Pr(F ) = .5, so the first step is to just add these. Then we subtract out the intersection, which we double counted. In this case, the intersection U  F is just U (check the diagram), and so subtract out the whole .4. The answer is .5, as it should be. \nBy the way, you'll notice that if the two sets in question are mutu\n4.2. PROBABILITY MEASURES 65 \nally exclusive, then there is no intersection to subtract out. That's a special case of rule 3. For example, suppose I defined the event C as a country singer winning the competition. In this case, C contains only one outcome: Carrie. Therefore U and C are mutually exclusive. So if I asked \"what's the probability of an underage or country winner?\" we'd compute Pr(U  C) as \n Pr(U  C) = Pr(U ) + Pr(C) - Pr(U  C) = .4 +. 1 - 0 =. 5. \nWe didn't double-count anything, so there was no correction to make. \nHere are a few more pretty obvious rules for probability measures, which follow logically from the first 3: \n4. Pr() = 0 \n5. Pr(A) = 1 -Pr(A) (recall the \"total complement\" operator     from p. 18.) \n6. Pr(A) <= Pr(B) if A  B \nFinally, let me draw attention to a common special case of the above rules, which is the situation in which all outcomes are equally likely. This usually happens when we roll dice, flip coins, deal cards, _etc._ since the probability of rolling a 3 is (normally) the same as rolling a 6, and the probability of being dealt the 10 is the same as the Q. It may also happen when we generate encryption keys, choose between alternate network routing paths, or determine the initial positions of baddies in a first-person shooter level. \nIn this case, if there are N possible outcomes (note N = |ohm|) then the probability of any event A is: \n Pr(A) = |A| N . \n66 CHAPTER 4. PROBABILITY \nIt's the size (cardinality) of the event set that matters, and the ratio of this number to the total number of events is the probability. For example, if we deal a card from a fair deck, the probability of drawing a face card is \n Pr(F ) = \n |F | N \n = |{K, K, K, * * * , J}| 52 \n = 12 52 = \n. 231. \nPlease realize that this shortcut _only_ applies when the probability of each outcome is the same. We certainly couldn't say, for example, that the probability of a user's password starting with the letter q is just 261 , because passwords surely don't contain all letters with equal frequency. (At least, I'd be very surprised if that were the case.) The only way to solve a problem like this is to know how often each letter of the alphabet occurs. \n**4.3 Philosophical interlude** \nWhich brings me to an important question. How do we get these probability numbers, anyway? Everything so far has assumed that the numbers have been dropped into our lap. \nThe answer depends somewhat on your interpretation of what probability _means_. If we say \"the probability of getting heads on a coin flip is .5,\" what are we really saying? There have traditionally been two opposing answers to this question, called the **frequentist** view and the **Bayesian** view. It's interesting to compare their claims. \nThe frequentist view is that we derive probabilities by simply running many trials, and counting the results. The proportions of various outcomes yield a good idea of their probabilities, particularly if the sample size is large. Consider flipping a coin. If we flip a coin ten times and count three heads, we might not have a great \n4.3. PHILOSOPHICAL INTERLUDE 67 \nidea of how often heads will occur in the long run. But if we flip it a million times and get 500,372 heads, we can confidently say that the probability of getting a head on a single flip is approximately .500. \nThis much isn't controversial: it's more like common sense. But the frequentist philosophy states that this is really the _only_ way that probability can be defined. It's what probability _is_ : the frequency with which we can expect certain outcomes to occur, based on our observations of their past behavior. Probabilities only make sense for things that are repeatable, and reflect a known, reliable trend in how often they produce certain results. Historical proponents of this philosophy include John Venn, the inventor of the aforementioned Venn diagram, and Ronald Fisher, one of the greatest biologists and statisticians of all time. \nIf frequentism is thus on a quest for experimental objectivity, Bayesianism might be called \"subjective.\" This isn't to say it's arbitrary or sloppy. It simply has a different notion of what probability ultimately means. Bayesians interpret probability as a quantitative personal assessment of the likelihood of something happening. They point out that for many (most) events of interest, trials are neither possible nor sensible. Suppose I'm considering asking a girl out to the prom, and I'm trying to estimate how likely it is she'll go with me. It's not like I'm going to ask her a hundred times and count how many times she says yes, then divide by 100 to get a probability. There is in fact no way to perform a trial or use past data to guide me, and at any rate she's only going to say yes or no once. So based on my background knowledge and my assumptions about her, myself, and the world, I form an opinion which could be quantified as a \"percent chance.\" \nOnce I've formed this opinion (which of course involves guesswork and subjectivity) I can then reason about it mathematically, using all the tools we've been developing. Of special interest to Bayesians is the notion of _updating_ probabilities when new information comes to light, a topic we'll return to in a moment. For the Bayesian, the probability of some hypothesis being true is between 0 and 1, and when an agent (a human, or a bot) makes decisions, he/she/it \n68 CHAPTER 4. PROBABILITY \ndoes so on the most up-to-date information he/she/it has, always revising beliefs in various hypotheses when confirming or refuting evidence is encountered. Famous Bayesians include Pierre-Simon Laplace, sometimes called \"the French Isaac Newton\" for his scientific brilliance, and 18 th^ century theologian Thomas Bayes, for whom the theory is named. \nI won't try to conceal that my own thinking on this topic is pretty Bayesian. But I find this whole topic fascinating because it shows how brilliant people, who unanimously agree on the rules and equations, can have such radically different interpretations of what it all means. \n**4.4 Conditional probability** \nI mentioned that Bayesians are especially concerned with the idea of revising estimates about probability based on new information that may come to light. This notion can be crystallized in the idea of **conditional probability**. When we talk about the conditional probability of an event A, we mean \"what's the probability that A occurs, _given_ that I know some other event K has also occurred?\" Think of K as \"background knowledge\": it's additional information which, when known, may influence how likely we think A is to have occurred. It can be mathematically computed as follows: \n Pr(A|K) = \n Pr(A  K) Pr(K) \nWe pronounce Pr(A|K) as \"the probability of A given K.\" It is the conditional probability of A, or \"the probability of A conditioned on K.\" We'll sometimes call plain old Pr(A) the **_a priori_** **probability** , or the **prior** probability if we don't want to sound Latin. The prior is simply the original unadjusted probability, if we aren't privy to the background information K. \nLet's go back to _American Idol_. We know that the probability of an underage winner is only .4, because U = { Kelly, Fantasia }, and we estimate that each of them has a .2 probability of winning. So it seems more likely than not that our winner will be over 21. But \n4.4. CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY 69 \nwait: suppose we had some additional information. Just before the outcome is announced, news is leaked through a Rupert Murdoch news source that the winner is a _woman_! If we believe this reporter, does that change our expectation about how old the winner is likely to be? \nIndeed it does. Knowing that the winner is female eliminates Dave from consideration. Looking back at Figure 4.1, we can see that once we know Dave is out of the running, the remaining pool consists of just F , which includes Kelly, Fantasia, and Carrie. The question is, how do we update our probability from .4 to reflect the fact that only these three ladies are left? \nIn this case F is the background knowledge: we know that the event F has occurred. And we want to know how likely U is to also have occurred. This is found easily: \n Pr(U |F ) = Pr(U  F ) Pr(F ) \n = \n Pr({Kelly,Fantasia}) Pr({Kelly,Fantasia,Carrie}) = \n. 4 .5 = \n. 8. \nOur estimated chance of an underage winner doubled once we found out she was female (even though we don't yet know _which_ female). \nIf you stare at the equation and diagram, you'll see the rationale for this formula. Kelly and Fantasia originally had only .4 of the entire probability between them. But once David was axed, the question became: \"what percentage of the _remaining_ probability do Kelly and Fantasia have?\" The answer was no longer .4 out of 1, but .4 out of .5, since only .5 of the whole was left post-David. This is why we divided by Pr(F ): that's what we know remains given our background fact. \nNow in this case, the conditional probability was higher than the original probability. Could it ever be lower? Easily. Consider the probability of a rock-star winner, Pr(R). _A priori_ , it's .7. But \n70 CHAPTER 4. PROBABILITY \nagain, let's say we had information leaked to us that the winner, whoever she may be, is female. We can now update our estimate: \n Pr(R|F ) = \n Pr(R  F ) Pr(F ) \n = Pr({Kelly}) Pr({Kelly,Fantasia,Carrie}) = \n. 2 .5 = \n. 4. \nYou see, once we find out that David is no longer a possibility, our only remaining hope for a rock star is Kelly. And she has only 40% of the probability that's left over. Note that this is a higher chance for her personally -- she's got to be excited by the press leak -- but it's lower for _rock stars_ , of which she is only one (and evidently, not the predicted strongest). \nBackground knowledge can even peg our probability estimate to an extreme: all the way to 0, or to 1. What's Pr(U |C), the probability of an underage winner, given that he/she is a country singer? The intersection of U and C is zero, so this makes Pr(U |C) = 0. In words: a country winner eliminates any possibility of an underage winner. And what's Pr(F |U ), the probability that a woman wins, given that we know the winner to be underage? Well, F  U and U are the same (check me), so Pr Pr(F(^ U U) ) =..^44 = 1. Therefore, an underage winner guarantees a female winner. \nThe way I think about conditional probability is this: look at the diagram, consider the events known to have occurred, and then _mentally block out everything except that._ Once we know the background fact(s), we're essentially dealing with a restricted world. Take the example of the known female winner. Once we know that event F in fact occurred, we can visually filter out David, and look at the F blob as though that were our entire world. In this restricted female-only view, the underage elements comprise a greater percentage of the total than they did before. And half of the rock-star elements have now been obscured, leaving only Kelly as the one-of-the-remaining-three. \n4.5. TOTAL PROBABILITY 71 \nMany psychologists, by the way, claim that we're constantly doing this sort of thing in our minds: gathering facts, then revising our beliefs about the world in light of those facts. We start by believing that Pr(X) is approximately some value.

It will be a linear function of the variables xf 1 , xf 2 , xf 3 , xf 4 (notice that f 5 = 8 does not reference a variable, but does tell us the final column is not a pivot column). We will now construct these three expressions. Notice that using subscripts upon subscripts takes some getting used to.

Each element of the set D = {d 1 , d 2 , d 3 } = { 1 , 3 , 4 } is the index of a variable. We refer to the variables xd 1 = x 1 , xd 2 = x 3 and xd 3 = x 4 as \"dependent\" variables \nSST S S B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 38 \nsince they depend on the independent variables. More precisely, for each possible choice of values for the independent variables we get exactly one set of values for the dependent variables that combine to form a solution of the system. To express the solutions as a set, we write      \n     \n         \n 4 - 4 x 2 - 2 x 5 - x 6 + 3x 7 x 2 2 - x 5 + 3x 6 - 5 x 7 1 - 2 x 5 + 6x 6 - 6 x 7 x 5 x 6 x 7 \n         \n | | | | || | | | | | | | x 2 , x 5 , x 6 , x 7  C \n          \nThe condition that x 2 , x 5 , x 6 , x 7  C is how we specify that the variables x 2 , x 5 , x 6 , x 7 are \"free\" to assume any possible values. This systematic approach to solving a system of equations will allow us to create a precise description of the solution set for any consistent system once we have found the reduced row-echelon form of the augmented matrix. It will work just as well when the set of free variables is empty and we get just a single solution. And we could program a computer to do it! Now have a whack at Archetype J (Exercise TSS.C10), mimicking the discussion in this example. We'll still be here when you get back. 4 \nUsing the reduced row-echelon form of the augmented matrix of a system of equations to determine the nature of the solution set of the system is a very key idea. So let us look at one more example like the last one. But first a definition, and then the example. We mix our metaphors a bit when we call variables free versus dependent. Maybe we should call dependent variables \"enslaved\"? \nDefinition IDV Independent and Dependent Variables Suppose A is the augmented matrix of a consistent system of linear equations and B is a row-equivalent matrix in reduced row-echelon form. Suppose j is the index of a pivot column of B. Then the variable xj is dependent. A variable that is not dependent is called independent or free. \u0003 \nIf you studied this definition carefully, you might wonder what to do if the system has n variables and column n + 1 is a pivot column? We will see shortly, by Theorem RCLS, that this never happens for a consistent system. \nExample FDV Free and dependent variables Consider the system of five equations in five variables, \n x 1 - x 2 - 2 x 3 + x 4 + 11x 5 = 13 x 1 - x 2 + x 3 + x 4 + 5x 5 = 16 2 x 1 - 2 x 2 + x 4 + 10x 5 = 21 2 x 1 - 2 x 2 - x 3 + 3x 4 + 20x 5 = 38 2 x 1 - 2 x 2 + x 3 + x 4 + 8x 5 = 22 \nwhose augmented matrix row-reduces to       1 - 1 0 0 3 6 0 0 1 0 - 2 1 0 0 0 1 4 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n       \nColumns 1, 3 and 4 are pivot columns, so D = { 1 , 3 , 4 }. From this we know that the variables x 1 , x 3 and x 4 will be dependent variables, and each of the r = 3 nonzero rows of the row-reduced matrix will yield an expression for one of these \n SST S S B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 39 \n three variables. The set F is all the remaining column indices, F = { 2 , 5 , 6 }. The column index 6 in F means that the final column is not a pivot column, and thus the system is consistent (Theorem RCLS). The remaining indices in F indicate free variables, so x 2 and x 5 (the remaining variables) are our free variables. The resulting three equations that describe our solution set are then, (xd 1 = x 1 ) x 1 = 6 + x 2 - 3 x 5 (xd 2 = x 3 ) x 3 = 1 + 2x 5 (xd 3 = x 4 ) x 4 = 9 - 4 x 5 Make sure you understand where these three equations came from, and notice how the location of the pivot columns determined the variables on the left-hand side of each equation. We can compactly describe the solution set as, \n S = \n    \n   \n      \n 6 + x 2 - 3 x 5 x 2 1 + 2x 5 9 - 4 x 5 x 5 \n      \n | | | | | | | | | \n x 2 , x 5  C \n    \n   \nNotice how we express the freedom for x 2 and x 5 : x 2 , x 5  C. 4 Sets are an important part of algebra, and we have seen a few already. Being comfortable with sets is important for understanding and writing proofs. If you have not already, pay a visit now to Section SET. We can now use the values of m, n, r, and the independent and dependent variables to categorize the solution sets for linear systems through a sequence of theorems. Through the following sequence of proofs, you will want to consult three proof techniques. See Proof Technique E, Proof Technique N, Proof Technique CP. First we have an important theorem that explores the distinction between consistent and inconsistent linear systems. Theorem RCLS Recognizing Consistency of a Linear System Suppose A is the augmented matrix of a system of linear equations with n variables. Suppose also that B is a row-equivalent matrix in reduced row-echelon form with r nonzero rows. Then the system of equations is inconsistent if and only if column n + 1 of B is a pivot column. \n Proof. (=) The first half of the proof begins with the assumption that column n + 1 of B is a pivot column. Then the leading 1 of row r is located in column n + 1 of B and so row r of B begins with n consecutive zeros, finishing with the leading 1. This is a representation of the equation 0 = 1, which is false. Since this equation is false for any collection of values we might choose for the variables, there are no solutions for the system of equations, and the system is inconsistent. (=) For the second half of the proof, we wish to show that if we assume the system is inconsistent, then column n + 1 of B is a pivot column. But instead of proving this directly, we will form the logically equivalent statement that is the contrapositive, and prove that instead (see Proof Technique CP). Turning the implication around, and negating each portion, we arrive at the logically equivalent statement: if column n + 1 of B is not a pivot column, then the system of equations is consistent. If column n + 1 of B is not a pivot column, the leading 1 for row r is located somewhere in columns 1 through n. Then every preceding row's leading 1 is also located in columns 1 through n. In other words, since the last leading 1 is not in the last column, no leading 1 for any row is in the last column, due to the echelon layout of the leading 1's (Definition RREF). We will now construct a solution to the system by setting each dependent variable to the entry of the final column in the row with the corresponding leading 1, and setting each free variable to zero. That \n SST S S B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 40 \nsentence is pretty vague, so let us be more precise. Using our notation for the sets D and F from the reduced row-echelon form (Definition RREF): xdi = [B]i,n+1 , 1 <= i <= r xfi = 0, 1 <= i <= n - r These values for the variables make the equations represented by the first r rows of B all true (convince yourself of this). Rows numbered greater than r (if any) are all zero rows, hence represent the equation 0 = 0 and are also all true. We have now identified one solution to the system represented by B, and hence a solution to the system represented by A (Theorem REMES). So we can say the system is consistent (Definition CS). \u0004 \nThe beauty of this theorem being an equivalence is that we can unequivocally test to see if a system is consistent or inconsistent by looking at just a single entry of the reduced row-echelon form matrix. We could program a computer to do it! Notice that for a consistent system the row-reduced augmented matrix has n + 1  F , so the largest element of F does not refer to a variable. Also, for an inconsistent system, n + 1  D, and it then does not make much sense to discuss whether or not variables </passage>"}], "prediction": "<tool_call>\n{'arguments': <args-dict>, 'name': 'ExpertQAExtractor'}\n</tool_call>\nfor the following passage <passage> RREFU),     \n 1 4 0 0 2 1 - 3 4 0 0 1 0 1 - 3 5 2 0 0 0 1 2 - 6 6 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n     \nSo we find that r = 3 and D = {d 1, d 2, d 3 } = { 1, 3, 4 } F = {f 1, f 2, f 3, f 4, f 5 } = { 2, 5, 6, 7, 8 } Let i denote any one of the r = 3 nonzero rows.

When you look at this alongside what Gloria Ladson-Billings calls the _educational debt_ , or the compounded impact of educational deficits that grow across generations of poor minority students, literacy efforts as they are currently framed paint a bleak picture for poor minority students (3-12). The issue is not just one of unequal access to opportunities. Jacqueline Jones Royster and Carmen Kynard illustrate how attitudes toward students as writers are interwoven with attitudes toward them as people. Language cannot be disassociated from people, which has important consequences for those who grow up speaking different dialects. By continuing to propagate the notion of correct and incorrect ways of speaking, we effectively devalue the intelligence and character of students, employees, and colleagues who, for whatever reasons, don't speak or write what in historical terms has been called the King's English (among other names). We use the perception of improper communication as evidence of others' lesser character or ability, despite recognizing that this country was united (if only in name) after declaring independence from that king (Kynard; Royster). This perception becomes all the more problematic because it is about not just devaluing individuals but the widespread practice of devaluing the literate practices of those who are already marginalized. David Gold highlights how the literacy of African Americans, women, and working-class and rural people has been marginalized in our understanding of writing. Gold writes about how the literacy practices of African Americans in universities laid the groundwork for the civil rights movement. Indeed, the schools he studied were decades ahead of the larger national conversation on how literacy, identity, and power were interrelated. In her work examining how literacy and identity formation were key for African American women and for social change, Jacqueline Jones Royster discusses the importance of understanding these cultural, identity, and social movements, echoing the impact marginalized scholars had A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 18 \nin academia. Both demonstrate the detrimental impact of sidelining groups of people and their literate practices by devaluing their languages and their experiences, not just for those who are marginalized but for our larger understanding of how we as a society write. The notion of one correct way of writing is also troubling because it operates under the assumption that linguistic differences are the result of error. The reality is that for many speakers, what we might perceive as a mistake is actually a system of difference. One notable example of a different dialect of English is Ebonics, which has different patterns of speech rooted in the ancestral heritage of its speakers. Similarly, immigrant groups will frequently speak and write English in a way that mirrors the linguistic heritage of their mother tongue. The way that we conceptualize language is not just detrimental to minorities; it also devalues the identities that workingand lower-class people bring to communicative situations, including the classroom. Lynn Z. Bloom writes that \"Freshman Composition is an unabashedly middle-class enterprise.\" She argues that one of the reasons composition is required for all students is because it promulgates middle-class values and ways of thinking. These values in the writing classroom are embodied in everything from the notion of property, which undergirds the way that plagiarism and intellectual property are treated, to the formality of language and rhetorical choices that are encouraged in papers (654-675). Indeed, the way many instructors teach writing, plagiarism, citation, and word choice in papers is not in and of itself good but rather is the socially accepted way of interacting with text as defined by the middle class. Mike Rose and Irvin Peckham often write about the tension of middle-class values on working-class students and the cognitive dissonance and struggles with identity that come with imposing such values in writing under the guise of correctness. The idea that there is one correct way of writing devalues the writing, thoughts, intelligence, and identities of people from lower-class backgrounds. Pragmatically, many argue that standard English should be dominant in the binary between academic English and all other dialects in order for speakers and writers to communicate with credibility in their communities. This argument has been used to justify the continued attention to correctness at the expense of authors' voices, but we can teach people to adapt while also valuing their identities. We can talk about writing as something that they can employ to their benefit rather than a hegemonic standard that supersedes their backgrounds, identities, and experiences. In order to value the diversity of communication and identities that exist in the US, we need to start teaching and envisioning writing as a cultural and social activity. We need a more nuanced view of writing in society that encourages everyone to adapt to their audiences and contexts rather than placing an undue burden on those who do not fit the mold of standard English. One strategy for teaching academic English without devaluing a writer's identity is codeswitching, a concept already taught in schools with significant minority populations as a way of empowering young people. While instruction in code-switching is valuable because it teaches students that they can adopt different linguistic choices to appeal to different audiences, it is deeply problematic that the impetus is still placed on minority students with nonstandard dialects to adapt. While code-switching is meant to empower people, it is still rooted in the mentality that there is one correct way of writing, because even as code-switching teaches an incredibly nuanced way of thinking about writing, it is still being taught in the context 19 COLLECTED WORKS \nof preparing writers to deal with a society that will use errors in speaking as evidence that they are lesser. As a result, it is a less-than-ideal solution because it plays into--rather than undermines--the racism of academic English. By perpetuating the myth of one correct way of writing, we are effectively marginalizing substantial swaths of the population linguistically and culturally. The first step in combating this is as easy as recognizing how correctness reinforces inequality and affects our own perceptions of people and questioning our assumptions about communication, and a second step is valuing code-switching in a wide swath of communicative situations. The original chapter, _There Is One Correct Way of Writing and Speaking_ by Anjali Pattanayak, is from Bad Ideas about Writing \n**1.** What new ideas were here for you to consider? In what ways did this     chapter challenge your way of thinking? \n**2.** Pattanayak suggests that one way to address students' different     backgrounds and dialects is to incorporate more explicit discussion about     code-switching in the classroom. Is this a satisfying solution? Why or why     not? What are the benefits or problems with this approach? \n**3.** Is it possible to be true to your own voice and also succeed in academia?     What might that look like? Is that option more available to some students     than others? \n#### DISCUSSION QUESTIONS \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 20 \n**1.** Freewrite about the different \"code-switching\" spaces in your own life.     How do you speak differently in different contexts? How does it feel to     shift back and forth between those voices? \n**2.** Research the term \"code-switching\" and learn more about who is under the     most pressure to code-switch and why. How does this add to your     understanding of Pattanayak's argument? What might be problematic     about using the term to describe other kinds of language adjustment in the     classroom? \n#### ACTIVITIES \n21 COLLECTED WORKS \n**1.** While the notion of what constitutes academic English has remained     relatively static in popular culture, the reality of writing in the university     has broadened to include many other types of writing. Patricia Bizzell,     Helen Fox, and Christopher Shroeder compile arguments for addressing     these other types of communication in _Alt Dis: Alternative Discourses and the_     _Academy_. \n**2.** In _College Writing and Beyond_ , Anne Beaufort provides a framework in     which to understand how writing is dynamic. In her article \"Freshman     Composition as a Middle-Class Enterprise,\" Lynn Z. Bloom articulates the     ways in which the cultural values of the middle class are being taught in the     writing classroom as objectively good or true and the impact of this     mentality. Additionally, Asao Inoue compiles a collection of articles in _Race_     _and Writing Assessment_ that provides frameworks for considering race in     assessment practices. \n**3.** In 1974, the Conference for College Composition and Communication     passed the resolution _Students' Right to Their Own Language_. In the time     since it passed, there has been a great deal of discussion around the     wisdom of that resolution. Editors Austin Jackson, David E. Kirkland, and     Staci Perryman-Clark compile short articles for and against this resolution. \n**4.** Bruce Horner, Min-Zhan Lu, Jacqueline Jones Royster, and John Trimbur     write about how the increasing number of English speakers in the world is     increasing linguistic diversity in \"Opinion: Language Difference in Writing:     Toward a Translingual Approach.\" Additionally, Irvin Peckham writes     extensively with a focus on working-class students in the classroom and     the impact of college and academic writing as a middle-class enterprise in     \"The Stories We Tell.\" For more on the history and cultural development of     African American Vernacular English, consider _Beyond Ebonics: Linguistic_     _Pride and Racial Prejudice_ by John Baugh. \n#### ADDITIONAL RESOURCES \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 22 \n Armstrong, Elizabeth A., and Laura T.

What I normally do just isn't working!\" That's a familiar feeling for all writers. Sometimes the writing just seems to flow as if by magic, but then the flow stops cold. Your brain seems to have run out of things to say. If you just wait for the magic to come back, you might wait a long time. What professional writers know is that writing takes consistent effort. Writing comes out of a regular practice--a habit. Professional writers also know that not everything they write ends up in the final draft. Sometimes we have to write what Anne Lamott calls a \"shitty first draft.\" One of my favorite writing professors, Duncan Carter, used to say that he was a terrible writer but a great reviser, and that's what helped him write when inspiration wasn't available. So how do writers get going when they feel stuck or uninspired? They develop a set of habits and have more than one way to write to get the words flowing again. You might associate the idea of writing anxiety or writer's block with procrastination, and procrastination certainly can be either a cause or an effect of writing anxiety. But writing anxiety or writer's block is more of a condition or state of being. We'll start by defining the term--so that you can figure out if you have it--and then cover some ways to work through it. Do you worry excessively about writing assignments? Do they make you feel uneasy or agitated? Do you have negative feelings about certain types of writing? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you might be dealing with writing anxiety. Writing anxiety simply means that a writer is experiencing negative feelings about a given writing task. Writing anxiety is often more about the audience and/or purpose for a given writing task than it is about the mere act of writing itself. Say you just bought a new pair of headphones. You brought them home, removed all the packaging, and connected them to your phone, and they're \n#### WHAT IS WRITING ANXIETY AND HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE IT? \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 24 \n amazing! So you decide to visit the company website, and you write a stellar review of the product, giving it a five-star rating and including descriptive details about the headphones' comfortable fit, excellent sound quality, ability to cancel outside noise, and reasonable price.
