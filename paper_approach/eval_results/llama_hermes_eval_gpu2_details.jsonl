Very specific, higher stakes, more complex answers As you hone your path of inquiry, you may need to zoom in or out in terms of scope: depending on your rhetorical situation, you will need different degrees of focus. Just like narration, research writing benefits from a careful consideration of scope. Often, a narrower scope is easier to work with than a broader scope--you will be able to write more and write better if your question asks for more complex thinking. It's important to be flexible throughout your research project. Be prepared to pivot topics, adjust your research question, change your opinions, and confront unanticipated challenges. As you build a working knowledge of your topic, you might complicate or narrow your working questions. Gradually, try to articulate a research question (or combination of questions). Remember to be flexible as you research though: you might need to pivot, adjust, refocus, or replace your research question as you learn more. Consider this imaginary case study as an example of this process: Ahmed began his project by identifying the following areas of interest: racism in the US, technology in medicine and health care, and independent filmmaking. After doing some freewriting and preliminary research on each, he decided he wanted to learn more about racially motivated police violence. He developed working questions: \n#### WORKING QUESTIONS \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 146 \n Are police officers likely to make judgments about citizens based on their race?  Have police forces instituted policies to avoid racism?  Who is most vulnerable to police violence?  Why does it seem like police officers target people of color? Who is responsible for overseeing the police? He realized that he needed to narrow his focus to develop a more viable path of inquiry, eventually ending up with the following research question:  Over the last thirty years, what populations are most likely to experience police violence in the US? However, after completing more research, Ahmed discovered that his answers came pretty readily: young Black men are significantly more vulnerable to be victims of police violence. He realized that he was not really saying anything new, so he had to tweak his path of inquiry. Ahmed did some more freewriting and dug around to find a source that disagreed with him or added a new layer to his answers. He discovered eventually that there are a handful of police organizations that have made genuine efforts to confront racism in their practices. Despite the widespread and normalized violence enacted against people of color, these groups were working against racial violence. He reoriented his research question to be the following:  Have antiracist police trainings and strategies been effective in reducing individual or institutional racism over the last thirty years?

Create a catalog of topics you are personally curious     about--things that you want to learn more about.

After stumbling, review the list you've made of potentially interesting topics. Are you already familiar with any of them? Which surprised you? Are there any relationships or intersections worth exploring further? From these topics and subtopics, try to articulate a viable and interesting research question that speaks to your curiosity. \n**3.** Moving from topics to questions: Small group activity.

Such consternation! Educators are fond of research papers because they require you to find your own sources, confront conflicting evidence, and synthesize diverse information and ideas--all skills required in any professional leadership role. Research papers also allow students to pursue their own topic of interest; your professors have to assume that you are genuinely interested in at least some major part of the course. The open-endedness of research papers sets you up to do your best work as a self-motivated scholar. This chapter is about secondary sources: what they are, where to find them, and how to choose them. For example, let's think about the distinction between primary and secondary sources. Primary sources are original documents, data, or images: the law code of the Le Dynasty in Vietnam, the letters of Kurt Vonnegut, data gathered from an experiment on color perception, an interview, or Farm Service Administration photographs from the 1930s. Secondary sources are produced by analyzing primary sources. They include news articles, scholarly articles, reviews of films or art exhibitions, documentary films, and other pieces that have some descriptive or analytical purpose. Some things may be primary sources in one context but secondary sources in another. For example, if you're using news articles to inform an analysis of a historical event, they're serving as secondary sources. If you're counting the number of times a particular newspaper reported on different types of events, then the news articles are serving as primary sources because they're more akin to raw data. You've probably heard by now that if you cite Wikipedia as an authoritative source, the wrath of your instructor shall be visited upon you. Why is it that even the most informative Wikipedia articles are still often considered illegitimate? And what are good sources to use? The table below summarizes the types of secondary sources in four tiers. All sources have their legitimate uses, but the top-tier ones are preferable for citation in an academic context. \n#### AH, THE RESEARCH PAPER \n#### SOME SOURCES ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 154 \n Table 20.1 Analyzing the quality of secondary sources \n##### Tier Type Content Uses How to find them \n##### Tier \n##### I \n Peer-reviewed academic publications Rigorous research and analysis Provide strong evidence for claims and references to other high-quality sources Google Scholar, library catalogs, and academic article databases \n##### Tier \n##### II \n Reports, articles, and books from credible nonacademic sources Well-researched and even-handed descriptions of an event or state of the world Initial research on events or trends not yet analyzed in the academic literature; may reference important Tier 1 sources Websites of relevant agencies, Google searches using *.gov or *.org sites, academic article databases \n##### Tier \n##### III \n Short pieces from newspapers or credible websites Simple reporting of events, research findings, or policy changes Often point to useful Tier 2 or Tier 1 sources; may provide a factoid or two not found anywhere else Strategic Google searches or article databases, including newspapers and magazines \n##### Tier \n##### IV \n Agenda-driven or uncertain pieces Mostly opinion, varying in thoughtfulness and credibility May represent a particular position within a debate; more often provide keywords and clues about higher-quality sources Nonspecific Google </passage>\n\n<|assistant|>\n", "prediction": "Can you help me extract queries from the following passage <passage> 1.

Thus, you can accept the findings as legitimate and just focus on the passages that explain the findings and their significance in plainer language. If you have a really good article that's a few years old, you can use article databases to find newer articles that cited it in their own literature reviews. That immediately tells you which ones are on the same topic and offer newer findings. On the other hand, if your first source is recent, the literature review section will describe the other papers in the same line of research. You can look them up directly. Students sometimes grumble when they're ordered to use scholarly articles in their research. It seems a lot easier to just Google some terms and find stuff that way. However, academic articles are the most efficient resource out there. They are vetted by experts and structured specifically to help readers zero in on the most important passages. Your campus library pays big money to subscribe to databases for Tier 1 articles. Some are general purpose databases that include the most prominent journals across disciplines, and some are specific to a particular discipline. Often they have the full text of the articles right there for you to save or print. We won't go over particular databases here because every campus has different offerings. If you haven't already attended a workshop on using the resources provided \n##### 1. Find them quickly \n##### 2. Use the abstracts \n##### 3. Read strategically \n##### 4. Don't sweat the technical stuff \n##### 5. Use one article to find others \n#### FINDING TIER 1 SOURCES \n##### ARTICLE DATABASES \n 159 COLLECTED WORKS \n by your library, you should. A one-hour workshop will save you many, many hours in the future. If there aren't any workshops, you can always seek advice from librarians and other library staff on the best databases for your topic. Many libraries also have online research guides that point you to the best databases for the specific discipline and, perhaps, the specific course. Librarians are eager to help you succeed with your research--it's their job and they love it!--so don't be shy about asking. Another popular article database is Google Scholar. It looks like a regular Google search, and it aspires to include the vast majority of published scholarship. Google doesn't share a list of which journals they include or how Google Scholar works, which limits its utility for scholars. Also, because it's so wide ranging, it can be harder to find the most appropriate sources. However, if you want to cast a wide net, it's a very useful tool. Here are three tips for using Google Scholar effectively: If you just put in \"crime,\" for example, Google Scholar will return all sorts of stuff from sociology, psychology, geography, and history. If your paper is on crime in French literature, your best sources may be buried under thousands of papers from other disciplines. A set of search terms like \"crime French literature modern\" will get you to relevant sources much faster. When you click on links to articles in Google Scholar, you may end up on a publisher's site that tells you that you can download the article for $20 or $30. Don't do it! You probably have access to virtually all the published academic literature through your library resources. Write down the key information (authors' names, title, journal title, volume, issue number, year, page numbers) and go find the article through your library website. If you don't have immediate full-text access, you may be able to get it through an interlibrary loan. If you get one great hit on Google Scholar, you can quickly see a list of other papers that cited it. For example, the search terms \"crime economics\" yielded this hit for a 1988 paper that appeared in a journal called Kyklos: Fig 20.1 Google Scholar The year 1988 is quite a while ago; for a social science paper, you probably want more recent sources. You can see that, according to Google, this paper was cited by 392 other sources. You can click on the \"Cited by 392\" to see that list. You can even search within that list of 392 if you're trying to narrow down the topic. For example, you could search the term \"cities\" to see which of those 392 articles are most likely to be about the economic impact of crime on cities. \n##### 1. Add your field (economics, psychology, French, etc.) as one of your keywords \n##### 2. Don't ever pay for an article \n##### 3. Use the \"cited by\" feature \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 160 \n You'll probably engage the subscription article databases at different points in the process. For example, imagine you've been assigned a research paper that can focus on any topic relevant to the course. Imagine further that you don't have a clue about where to start and aren't entirely sure what counts as an appropriate topic in this discipline. A great approach is to find the top journals in the specific field of your course and browse through recent issues to see what people are publishing on. For example, when I assign an open-topic research paper in my Introduction to Sociology course, I suggest that students looking for a topic browse recent issues of Social Problems or the American Journal of Sociology and find an article that looks interesting. They'll have a topic and--booyah!--their first source. An instructor of a class on kinesiology might recommend browsing Human Movement Science, the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, or Perceptual and Motor Skills. When you have a topic and are looking for a set of sources, your biggest challenge is finding the right keywords. You'll never find the right sources without them. You'll obviously start with words and phrases from the assignment prompt, but you can't stop there. As explained above, lower-tier sources (such as Wikipedia) or the top-tier sources you already have are great for identifying alternative keywords, and librarians and other library staff are also well practiced at finding new approaches to try. Librarians can also point you to the best databases for your topic as well. As you assess your evidence and further develop your thesis through the writing process, you may need to seek additional sources. For example, imagine you're writing a paper about the added risks adolescents face when they have experienced their parents' divorce. As you synthesize the evidence about negative impacts, you begin to wonder if scholars have documented some positive impacts as well. Thus you delve back into the literature to look for more articles, find some more concepts and keywords (such as \"resiliency\"), assess new evidence, and revise your thinking to account for these broader perspectives. Your instructor may have asked you to turn in a bibliography weeks before the final paper draft. You can check with your professor, but he or she is probably perfectly fine with you seeking additional sources as your thinking evolves. That's how scholars write. Finding good sources is a much more creative task than it seems on the face of it. It's an extended problem-solving exercise, an iterative cycle of questions and answers. Go ahead and use Wikipedia to get broadly informed if you want. It won't corrupt your brain. But use it, and all other sources, strategically. You should eventually arrive at a core set of Tier 1 sources that will enable you to make a well-informed and thoughtful argument in support of your thesis. It's also a good sign when you find yourself deciding that some of the first sources you found are no longer relevant to your thesis; that likely means that you have revised and specified your thinking and are well on your way to constructing the kind of self-driven in-depth analysis that your professor is looking for.

What sources--or types of     sources--could be considered \"agenda-driven\" Tier 4 sources? \n**3.** If you are unfamiliar with a source or author, how can you determine if it is     agenda driven or otherwise not credible? \n**4.** Is there ever a case where a Tier 4 source could be useful in an academic     paper? \n**5.** Which tiers of sources are the easiest to find? Which ones are the hardest?     Why? \n**1.** Choose a research topic, enter it into Google and then into Google Scholar,     and compare your results.

Even the most basic projects required sifting through card catalogs, scrolling through endless microfiche and microfilm slides, and dedicating hours to scouring the stacks of different libraries. But now, there is no dearth of information; indeed, the internet has connected us to more information than any single person could process in an entire lifetime. Once you have determined which conversation you want to join, it's time to begin finding sources. Inquiry-based research requires many encounters with a diversity of sources, so the internet serves us well by enabling faster, more expansive access. But while the internet makes it much easier to find those sources, it comes with its own host of challenges. The biggest problems with primarily internet-based research can be boiled down to two issues: \n**1.** There is too much out there to sift through everything that might be relevant. \n**2.** There is an increased prominence of unreliable, biased, or simply untrue     information. This chapter focuses on developing strategies and techniques to make your research and research writing processes more efficient, reliable, and meaningful, especially when considering the unique difficulties presented by research writing in the digital age. Specifically, you will learn strategies for discovering, evaluating, and integrating sources. \n##### Research Methods: Discovering Sources \n Let's bust a myth before going any further: there is no such thing as a \"good\" source. What makes a source \"good\" is actually determined by your purpose: how you use the source in your text is most important to determining its value. If you plan to present something as \n#### TECHNIQUES \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 164 \n truth--like a fact or statistic--it is wise to use a peer-reviewed journal article (one that has been evaluated by a community of scholars). But if you're trying to demonstrate a perspective or give evidence, you may not find what you need in a journal. Table 21.1 An example of position that might need more than scholarly resources \n##### Your \n##### position \n##### A supporting fact \n##### (something you present as factual ) \n##### An example that demonstrates your \n##### position \n##### (something that you present as a \n##### perspective ) \n Women are unfairly criticized on social media.

As you discover useful sources, try to expand your usual research process by experimenting with the techniques and resources included in this chapter. The first and most important determining factor of your research is where you choose to begin. Although there are a great number of credible and useful texts available across different search platforms, I generally encourage my students to begin with two resources: \n**1.** Their college or university's library and its website \n**2.** Google Scholar These resources are not bulletproof, and you can't always find what you need through them. However, their general search functionality and the databases from which they draw tend to be more reliable, specific, and professional.

You need to determine whether the source is credible, useful, and relevant to your research question. You need to determine whether the source is worth your time. There are several criteria you can use to evaluate a source. Here are some of the most important ones: \n**1.** Authority: Is the author an expert in the field? Is the author credible? \n**2.** Purpose: What is the author's purpose in writing the text? Is the author trying to persuade the reader, or is the author trying to inform the reader? \n**3.** Point of view: What is the author's point of view? Is the author biased? \n**4.** Audience: Who is the author writing for? Is the author writing for a general audience, or is the author writing for a specialized audience? \n**5.** Format: What is the format of the source?

Doing outside research enriches the conversation in your paper, builds your fluency and confidence in the subject, and can bolster (or challenge) your own argument. As a writer, it's important to give credit to the original author whenever you use outside words or ideas. This is true in every academic discipline, and it's true in less formal contexts, as well. Imagine that you're scrolling through Instagram or TikTok (or whatever cool new social media platform has been invented since these words were written--the challenge of writing in such a fast-moving world!). If an influencer uses someone else's audio clip or artwork, it's considered basic internet courtesy to tag the original source to give them credit. In fact, if reposters don't do this, the original creator might publicly complain and accuse the \"borrower\" of stealing their work. Why do they care? Why does it matter to the creators or artists if someone reposts their artwork? Some people would argue that reposting helps spread the art around, so it's actually good for the original artist. That makes sense, to a point--but how does that argument hold up if the original creator isn't tagged or attributed in any way? Your answers to those questions are probably similar to the reasons why citation matters in academia. Researchers and authors are generally glad for others to reference their work--after all, they published it rather than keeping it in a private diary--but they want credit for the work they've done. Using someone else's words or ideas without citing them--or citing them incorrectly--can feel like stealing. The original author (or content creator) only benefits from the \"repost\" if you cite their work, leading others back to the original source. In that sense, citation is an ethical issue: giving credit where credit is due. Don't get me wrong though. Citation isn't a purely selfless act. It also benefits you, the writer! Citing your sources builds your credibility as a speaker on the subject because it shows your audience that you have done your research. It gives your statements more weight by indicating that they came from a reliable source. (You should, of course, be using reliable sources; chapters 22 and 23 on evaluating sources can help you determine whether a source is trustworthy.) \n#### CITATION IS GOOD FOR CREATORS \n#### CITATION IS GOOD FOR YOU TOO \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 242 \n For example, if you write that there will be 25 million centenarians (people who are 100 years old or more) in the year 2100, your reader will immediately want to know how you reached that conclusion. \"Based on what?!\" they'll ask. If the statistic seems to come out of nowhere, your audience could be distracted by the statement. They might even wonder if your arguments or conclusions are well founded, since you seem to be pulling numbers from thin air. However, if you cite your source--and it's a reliable, reputable source--you will instantly build credibility with your audience. They will be more willing to accept the initial statistic and then listen to your argument on its own merits. You will show them that you have some knowledge on the topic and that your knowledge comes from authoritative sources. Consider the following examples. Which is the most credible? The answer is clear: it's the one with the specifics and the citation. There will be even more elderly people in the future. There will be more than 25 million centenarians in the year 2100. Although the United Nations predicts that there will be 25 million centenarians by 2100, other demographers have found that population transitions and global events make it harder to pinpoint. A truer estimate is somewhere between 13 and 50 million (Robine and Cubaynes 60). As you can see, citing your sources also pushes you to be more specific. In this case, I saw the \"25 million\" statistic in the article's abstract, but on closer reading, I found that the authors' research actually suggested a range. I had to read the article carefully to understand that point though--another key part of building your knowledge, fluency, and credibility. Now, depending on your purposes, you may wish for a simpler version of the information. In many cases though, the more complex (and research-supported) version works better--it's potentially more accurate and, honestly, more interesting. In every discipline, you need to cite outside words and ideas. If you're not sure whether to cite something or not, err on the side of caution and cite it! It's better to overcite than undercite. For example, you should always cite the following:  Quotes  Paraphrases  Statistics  Charts or other graphics  Images  Arguments or ideas  Original phrases \n#### WHAT TO CITE \n 243 COLLECTED WORKS \n Depending on your discipline, you might use some of these examples more than others. In the humanities, for example, quotes are an important form of evidence: how someone says something can be just as important as what they say. For that reason, quoting the original source is common in literature, history, and philosophy classes. In other fields, the data are the most important point. In your science and social science classes, then, you will probably rely mostly on statistics and paraphrases as supporting evidence. It's rare to see a direct quote in an engineering paper. Knowing what kinds of sources to use--and how to use them--is part of the learning you will do in your discipline. You can read example papers and articles in a particular field or ask your instructor for guidance. What's consistent across all of these disciplines, though, is the need to cite the information. If you are using outside words or ideas, you need to essentially tell your audience, \"Hey! This information came from another source. Here's how you can find it.\" You will do this by including two forms of citation for every outside source: (1) an in-text citation and (2) an end citation. \n##### In-text Citation \n The details of how to create citations will vary depending on what kind of class you're taking. In writing and other humanities courses, we often use MLA citation (which stands for Modern Language Association); psychology and other social sciences often use APA citation (American Psychological Association). Other citation styles include IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), CSE (Council of Science Editors), CMS ( Chicago Manual of Style ), and more. Ask your instructor which citation style you should use for each class. In all cases, though, you need to include an in-text citation (which will match up with an end citation--more on those in a minute). An in-text citation is like a signpost that says, \"This! This right here! I didn't make this up--it's from an outside, credible source.\" In MLA, this in-text citation is a parenthetical citation after the quote or paraphrase, like this: (Robine and Cubaynes 62). It typically includes the author's name and the page number that the information came from (if there is one). APA is similar but includes the author's last name and the year of publication, like this: (Garcia, 2008). In both cases, the reader will easily find more information on the alphabetized works cited or references page by looking in the G section for Garcia. Other citation styles may use a number enclosed in brackets [1] or a superscript number1 to indicate that this information is from an outside source. In those cases, the number 1 will lead the reader to the first entry on the references list, where they will find a full citation. What if there's no author listed? What if there are seventeen authors listed? The answer varies depending on your citation style--so you will have to do your own footwork to find the answer. The OWL at Purdue is an excellent resource for citation questions, whether you're working with MLA, APA, IEEE, or something else. \n#### HOW TO CITE \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 244 \n##### End Citations \n Similar to in-text citations, end citations vary quite a bit. In fact, even the name of the citations section varies: in MLA, we call this the \"works cited,\" while in other disciplines, you may see it being called \"references\" or \"bibliography.\" In all cases, though, the end citations provide significant details about the sources you cited in the text. As a general rule, your in-text citations and end citations should match up. If you have six sources listed on your works cited page but only one cited in the body of your paper, there's a problem. In this example, your reader will get the sense that you did some research--but they won't be able to tell which information came from which source or even which ideas were yours and which belong to someone else. To avoid this problem, cite as you go--don't wait until the end and try to insert citations throughout the paper. That's a recipe for disaster. While the specifics about formatting may vary, most end citations will include some or all of the following things in the order required by the style guide:  Author(s)  Title of the article  Title of the source it came from (e.g., the journal, newspaper, or website title)  Date of publication  Volume and issue number (for journals)  DOI or URL (for digital sources) Again, though, there will be variation across citation styles. Some elements may be italicized or in quote marks, for example, or the authors' names may use only first initials. While these differences and details may seem arbitrary, they're important because they tell careful readers what they're looking at. In MLA, the article title is in quotes and the journal title is italicized; if these markers are reversed, it's a little harder to figure out what we're looking at. Attention to detail here can also add to the professionalism and credibility of your paper as a whole. Here's the good news: you never have to memorize how to create perfect MLA or APA citations. What you do need to know, though, is that your sources have to be cited--and that you can find and apply the appropriate rules for your project whether it's in communications, psychology, or civil engineering. \n##### A Word About Citation Tools \n Real talk: how do you actually create citations for your papers? Chances are, you use a citation maker of some kind--either online, in the research database you are using, or embedded in Word or Google Docs. Instructors have different opinions about these, but I would argue that they're a valuable tool. Use what you have! A warning, though: citation tools are a useful starting point, but they're not perfect. The free online versions are especially prone to missing style updates or incorrect formatting. The 245 COLLECTED WORKS \ndatabase and word processor versions (as well as citation managers like Zotero and EndNote) tend to be better, but again--not perfect. They're only as good as the information they pick up from the source (or that you input, depending on the tool). For that reason, you should consider the citations that are churned out by these tools to be a rough draft. You will need to check them to ensure that they are accurate and consistent. \n**1.** Why is attribution important to online content creators? Do you know of     any examples where a creator was not given appropriate credit? How did it     impact them? \n**2.** Do you think that attribution/citation norms are shifting and changing in     the digital world? Do you see a generational divide, or does it seem more     important to some people than others? Why do you think that is? \n**1.** Use the OWL at Purdue to figure out how to create an in-text citation for     the following scenarios. Use the citation style of your class assignments.        **a.** A source with five authors **b.** A quote from one source that you found in another source (i.e., your article is referencing another article)        **c.** A source with no author listed \n**2.** Create one end citation the old-fashioned way: look it up on the OWL at     Purdue, find each required piece of information, and use the citation style     required in your class to write a full end citation for a source of your choice.     Talk through it as a class. Which pieces of information were hard to find?     Where are there points of confusion? How did this process help you better     understand the citation requirements? How might this help you in the     future, even if you continue to use citation tools? \n**3.** Use a citation maker of your choice to create an end citation for a source.     Then compare that citation to the guidance on the OWL at Purdue. Is     everything correct? What's missing or incorrect? \n#### DISCUSSION QUESTIONS \n#### ACTIVITIES \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 246 \n**1.** For more on citation tools and citation managers: Oregon State University     Libraries: Citations 101. \n**2.** For all of the details about how to cite very specific source types, both in     text and on the references page: The OWL at Purdue: Research and     Citation Resources.

Do you worry excessively about writing assignments? Do they make you feel uneasy or agitated? Do you have negative feelings about certain types of writing? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you might be dealing with writing anxiety. Writing anxiety simply means that a writer is experiencing negative feelings about a given writing task. Writing anxiety is often more about the audience and/or purpose for a given writing task than it is about the mere act of writing itself. Say you just bought a new pair of headphones. You brought them home, removed all the packaging, and connected them to your phone, and they're \n#### WHAT IS WRITING ANXIETY AND HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE IT? \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 24 \n amazing! So you decide to visit the company website, and you write a stellar review of the product, giving it a five-star rating and including descriptive details about the headphones' comfortable fit, excellent sound quality, ability to cancel outside noise, and reasonable price. Now let's say that the next day in biology class, your instructor covers the topic of biomes, and you learn about animal habitats and biodiversity and the interrelation and interdependence of species within biomes. You find it fascinating and can't wait to learn more. But then something terrible happens. Your instructor assigns a term project on the subject. As your instructor begins to describe the length and other specifications for the report, complete with formatting guidelines, citation requirements, and a bibliography at the end, your palms start to sweat, your stomach feels uneasy, and you begin to have trouble focusing on anything else your instructor has to say. You're experiencing writing anxiety. Writing anxiety is the condition of feeling uneasy about writing, and writer's block is what you experience when you can't manage to put words on the page. But these conditions aren't about the act of writing. Just yesterday, you wrote a great review for those cool new headphones. So why do you suddenly feel paralyzed by the thought of writing the biology essay? Let's consider some possible causes. The causes of writing anxiety are many. Here are just a few:  Inexperience with the type of writing task  Previous negative experiences with writing (e.g., someone, maybe a teacher, has given you negative feedback or said negative things about your writing)  Negative feelings about writing (e.g., \"I'm not a good writer,\" \"I hate writing\")  Immediate deadline  Distant deadline  Lack of interest in the topic  Personal problems or life events Your level of experience may explain why you felt comfortable writing the headphone review yet broke out in a sweat at the thought of the biology paper. If you've never written anything similar to a specific assignment, maybe you're unsure about whether you can meet the assignment requirements or the teacher's expectations. Or maybe the last time you turned in a written report for school you received negative feedback or a bad grade from the teacher. Maybe you procrastinated most of the term, and now the paper is due next week, and you feel overwhelmed. Or maybe it's the second week of the term and the deadline seems so far away that you're not motivated to write. Knowing the cause of your writing anxiety can help you move beyond it and get writing, even if you can't completely eliminate the problem. If the topic doesn't interest you or if you're having \n#### WHAT CAUSES WRITING ANXIETY? \n 25 COLLECTED WORKS \n problems at home, those probably aren't issues that will just disappear, but if you try some of the following strategies, I think you'll find that you can at least move forward with even the most anxiety inducing of writing assignments. There are a number of strategies that you can draw on to help you move past the feeling of being lost or stuck. Consider the following strategies to help you start writing again. \n##### Just Start Writing \n It might sound like it's oversimplifying the matter, but it's true. Half the battle is to just start writing. Try some strategies like freewriting or note-taking to get your writing muscles moving. Give yourself permission to write badly at this stage! Bruce Ballenger, a writer and professor of English at Boise State, explains why writing badly is an important part of the writing process: \"Giving myself permission to write badly makes it much more likely that I will write what I don't expect to write, and from those surprises will come some of my best writing. Writing badly is also a convenient alternative to staring off into space and waiting for inspiration.\" Sometimes the biggest problem writers have with getting started is that they feel like the writing needs to be good or well organized, or they feel like they need to start at the beginning. None of that is true. All you need to do is start. Have you ever seen a potter make a clay pot? Before a potter can start shaping or throwing a pot, they have to bring the big wet blob of clay and slap it down on the table. It's heavy and wet and messy, but it's the essential raw material. No clay? No pot. \"Bad writing\" is a lot like that. You have to dump all the words and ideas onto the table. Just get them out. Only then do you have the raw material you need to start shaping the words into something beautiful and lasting. You can wait until the revision stages to worry about shaping your writing to be its best. For now, just get the ideas on the table. \n##### Create Smaller Tasks And Short-Term Goals \n One of the biggest barriers to writing can be that the task just seems too large, and perhaps the due date is weeks away. Each of these conditions can contribute to feelings of being overwhelmed or to the tendency to procrastinate. But the remedy is simple and will help you keep writing something each week toward your deadline and toward the finished product: divide larger writing tasks into smaller, more manageable tasks, and set intermediate deadlines. The process that the authors used for writing this text provides a good example. As authors, we had to divide the text into sections, but we also had to plan the process for a first draft, peer reviews, and revisions, along with adding images, links, and other resources, not to mention the final publication of the text online. Had we not divided up the larger tasks into smaller ones and set short-term goals and deadlines, the process of writing the text would have been overwhelming. We didn't meet every single intermediate deadline right on time, but they helped move us along and helped us meet the most important deadline--the final one--with a complete text that was ready to publish on schedule. Imagine that you have a term paper that's assigned during Week 1 of an eleven-week term, and it's due during finals week. Make a list of all the tasks you can think of that need to be \n#### STRATEGIES FOR OVERCOMING OR MANAGING WRITING ANXIETY \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 26 \n completed, from beginning to end, to accomplish all that the assignment requires. List the tasks, and assign yourself due dates for each task. Consider taking it a step further, and create a task table that allows you to include a column for additional notes. Here's an example: Table 4.1 An example of a writing schedule. A modifiable and accessible download can be accessed here. \n##### Task \n##### Complete \n##### by \n##### Notes \n##### Brainstorm topics and select a topic. Wed., Week 2^ Notes: \n##### Do some preliminary research on the web to learn \n##### about the topic. \n Wed., Week 3 Notes: \n##### Develop list of search terms for some more focused \n##### research. \n Fri., Week 3 Notes: search terms.^ Ask instructor to look over my \n##### Spend some time at the library searching library \n##### holdings, databases, more focused research on the \n##### web. \n Mon., Week 4 Notes: time and transportation.^ Plan ahead to make sure I have \n##### Read sources and take notes.

Sometimes talking about your ideas is the best way to flesh them out and get more ideas flowing. Write down notes during or just after your conversation. 27 COLLECTED WORKS \n Classmates are a great resource because they're studying the same subjects as you and working on the same assignments. Talk to them often, and form study groups. Ask people to look at your ideas or writing and to give you feedback. Set goals and hold each other accountable for meeting deadlines (a little friendly competition can be motivating!). Talk to other potential readers. Ask them what they would expect from this type of writing. Meet with a tutor in your campus writing center. Be sure to come to the appointment prepared with a printed copy of the assignment and a short list of what you want to work on, along with a printed copy of your essay. \n##### Embrace Reality \n Don't imagine the situation of your writing assignment to be any better or worse than it really is. There are some important truths for you to recognize:  Focus on what you do best rather than fretting about your perceived weaknesses.  Acknowledge that writing can be difficult and that all you need to do is do your best.  Recognize what might be new or unfamiliar about the type of writing that you're doing.  Remember that you're a student and that you're supposed to be experiencing things that are new and unfamiliar (new formats, new audiences, new subject matter, new processes, new approaches, etc.).  Repeat the mantra \"It doesn't have to be perfect; it just has to be done .\" \n##### Seek Out Experts \n If you can, find more experienced writers (especially related to the type of writing that you're doing) and ask them questions. Sometimes, this might just mean a friend or family member who's already taken a couple of years of college courses. Maybe it's a fellow student who has already taken the class you're in now. Also, the tutors in your college writing center can be a big help at any stage in the writing process. Give them a call and make an appointment. And don't forget the expert you see all the time throughout any class that you take: your instructor. Ask your instructor for suggestions. That's what they're there for. Another way to learn from the experience of others is to look at examples of other pieces of writing of the type that you're working on. How is this piece organized? Does it make use of source material? What sort of tone does it use? If you don't know where to find examples, ask your instructor. If they don't have them at the ready, they'll likely be able to give you some suggestions about where to find some.
