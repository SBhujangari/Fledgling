If you have a really good article that's a few years old, you can use article databases to find newer articles that cited it in their own literature reviews. That immediately tells you which ones are on the same topic and offer newer findings. On the other hand, if your first source is recent, the literature review section will describe the other papers in the same line of research. You can look them up directly. Students sometimes grumble when they're ordered to use scholarly articles in their research. It seems a lot easier to just Google some terms and find stuff that way. However, academic articles are the most efficient resource out there. They are vetted by experts and structured specifically to help readers zero in on the most important passages. Your campus library pays big money to subscribe to databases for Tier 1 articles. Some are general purpose databases that include the most prominent journals across disciplines, and some are specific to a particular discipline. Often they have the full text of the articles right there for you to save or print. We won't go over particular databases here because every campus has different offerings. If you haven't already attended a workshop on using the resources provided \n##### 1. Find them quickly \n##### 2. Use the abstracts \n##### 3. Read strategically \n##### 4.

A one-hour workshop will save you many, many hours in the future. If there aren't any workshops, you can always seek advice from librarians and other library staff on the best databases for your topic. Many libraries also have online research guides that point you to the best databases for the specific discipline and, perhaps, the specific course. Librarians are eager to help you succeed with your research--it's their job and they love it!--so don't be shy about asking. Another popular article database is Google Scholar. It looks like a regular Google search, and it aspires to include the vast majority of published scholarship. Google doesn't share a list of which journals they include or how Google Scholar works, which limits its utility for scholars. Also, because it's so wide ranging, it can be harder to find the most appropriate sources. However, if you want to cast a wide net, it's a very useful tool. Here are three tips for using Google Scholar effectively: If you just put in \"crime,\" for example, Google Scholar will return all sorts of stuff from sociology, psychology, geography, and history. If your paper is on crime in French literature, your best sources may be buried under thousands of papers from other disciplines. A set of search terms like \"crime French literature modern\" will get you to relevant sources much faster. When you click on links to articles in Google Scholar, you may end up on a publisher's site that tells you that you can download the article for $20 or $30. Don't do it! You probably have access to virtually all the published academic literature through your library resources. Write down the key information (authors' names, title, journal title, volume, issue number, year, page numbers) and go find the article through your library website. If you don't have immediate full-text access, you may be able to get it through an interlibrary loan. If you get one great hit on Google Scholar, you can quickly see a list of other papers that cited it. For example, the search terms \"crime economics\" yielded this hit for a 1988 paper that appeared in a journal called Kyklos: Fig 20.1 Google Scholar The year 1988 is quite a while ago; for a social science paper, you probably want more recent sources. You can see that, according to Google, this paper was cited by 392 other sources. You can click on the \"Cited by 392\" to see that list. You can even search within that list of 392 if you're trying to narrow down the topic. For example, you could search the term \"cities\" to see which of those 392 articles are most likely to be about the economic impact of crime on cities. \n##### 1. Add your field (economics, psychology, French, etc.) as one of your keywords \n##### 2. Don't ever pay for an article \n##### 3. Use the \"cited by\" feature \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 160 \n You'll probably engage the subscription article databases at different points in the process. For example, imagine you've been assigned a research paper that can focus on any topic relevant to the course. Imagine further that you don't have a clue about where to start and aren't entirely sure what counts as an appropriate topic in this discipline. A great approach is to find the top journals in the specific field of your course and browse through recent issues to see what people are publishing on. For example, when I assign an open-topic research paper in my Introduction to Sociology course, I suggest that students looking for a topic browse recent issues of Social Problems or the American Journal of Sociology and find an article that looks interesting. They'll have a topic and--booyah!--their first source. An instructor of a class on kinesiology might recommend browsing Human Movement Science, the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research, or Perceptual and Motor Skills. When you have a topic and are looking for a set of sources, your biggest challenge is finding the right keywords. You'll never find the right sources without them. You'll obviously start with words and phrases from the assignment prompt, but you can't stop there. As explained above, lower-tier sources (such as Wikipedia) or the top-tier sources you already have are great for identifying alternative keywords, and librarians and other library staff are also well practiced at finding new approaches to try. Librarians can also point you to the best databases for your topic as well. As you assess your evidence and further develop your thesis through the writing process, you may need to seek additional sources. For example, imagine you're writing a paper about the added risks adolescents face when they have experienced their parents' divorce. As you synthesize the evidence about negative impacts, you begin to wonder if scholars have documented some positive impacts as well. Thus you delve back into the literature to look for more articles, find some more concepts and keywords (such as \"resiliency\"), assess new evidence, and revise your thinking to account for these broader perspectives. Your instructor may have asked you to turn in a bibliography weeks before the final paper draft. You can check with your professor, but he or she is probably perfectly fine with you seeking additional sources as your thinking evolves. That's how scholars write. Finding good sources is a much more creative task than it seems on the face of it. It's an extended problem-solving exercise, an iterative cycle of questions and answers. Go ahead and use Wikipedia to get broadly informed if you want. It won't corrupt your brain. But use it, and all other sources, strategically. You should eventually arrive at a core set of Tier 1 sources that will enable you to make a well-informed and thoughtful argument in support of your thesis. It's also a good sign when you find yourself deciding that some of the first sources you found are no longer relevant to your thesis; that likely means that you have revised and specified your thinking and are well on your way to constructing the kind of self-driven in-depth analysis that your professor is looking for.

Even the most basic projects required sifting through card catalogs, scrolling through endless microfiche and microfilm slides, and dedicating hours to scouring the stacks of different libraries. But now, there is no dearth of information; indeed, the internet has connected us to more information than any single person could process in an entire lifetime. Once you have determined which conversation you want to join, it's time to begin finding sources. Inquiry-based research requires many encounters with a diversity of sources, so the internet serves us well by enabling faster, more expansive access. But while the internet makes it much easier to find those sources, it comes with its own host of challenges. The biggest problems with primarily internet-based research can be boiled down to two issues: \n**1.** There is too much out there to sift through everything that might be relevant. \n**2.** There is an increased prominence of unreliable, biased, or simply untrue     information. This chapter focuses on developing strategies and techniques to make your research and research writing processes more efficient, reliable, and meaningful, especially when considering the unique difficulties presented by research writing in the digital age. Specifically, you will learn strategies for discovering, evaluating, and integrating sources. \n##### Research Methods: Discovering Sources \n Let's bust a myth before going any further: there is no such thing as a \"good\" source. What makes a source \"good\" is actually determined by your purpose: how you use the source in your text is most important to determining its value. If you plan to present something as \n#### TECHNIQUES \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 164 \n truth--like a fact or statistic--it is wise to use a peer-reviewed journal article (one that has been evaluated by a community of scholars). But if you're trying to demonstrate a perspective or give evidence, you may not find what you need in a journal. Table 21.1 An example of position that might need more than scholarly resources \n##### Your \n##### position \n##### A supporting fact \n##### (something you present as factual ) \n##### An example that demonstrates your \n##### position \n##### (something that you present as a \n##### perspective ) \n Women are unfairly criticized on social media.

As you discover useful sources, try to expand your usual research process by experimenting with the techniques and resources included in this chapter. The first and most important determining factor of your research is where you choose to begin. Although there are a great number of credible and useful texts available across different search platforms, I generally encourage my students to begin with two resources: \n**1.** Their college or university's library and its website \n**2.** Google Scholar These resources are not bulletproof, and you can't always find what you need through them.

You might first think that we'd add the two probabilities for the two events and be done with it, but a glance at the diagram tells you this means trouble. Pr(U ) is .4, and Pr(R) is .7. Even if we weren't very smart, we'd know something was wrong as soon as we added .4 + .7 = 1. 1 to get a probability of over 1 and violate rule 1. But we are smart, and looking at the diagram it's easy to see what happened: _we double-counted Kelly's probability._ Kelly was a member of both groups, so her .2 got counted in there twice. Now you can see the rationale for rule 3. To get Pr(U  R) we add Pr(U ) and Pr(R), but then we have to subtract back out the part we double-counted. And what did we double-count? Precisely the intersection U  R. \nAs a second example, suppose we want the probability of an underage or female winner? Pr(U ) = .4, and Pr(F ) = .5, so the first step is to just add these. Then we subtract out the intersection, which we double counted. In this case, the intersection U  F is just U (check the diagram), and so subtract out the whole .4. The answer is .5, as it should be. \nBy the way, you'll notice that if the two sets in question are mutu\n4.2. PROBABILITY MEASURES 65 \nally exclusive, then there is no intersection to subtract out. That's a special case of rule 3. For example, suppose I defined the event C as a country singer winning the competition. In this case, C contains only one outcome: Carrie. Therefore U and C are mutually exclusive. So if I asked \"what's the probability of an underage or country winner?\" we'd compute Pr(U  C) as \n Pr(U  C) = Pr(U ) + Pr(C) - Pr(U  C) = .4 +. 1 - 0 =. 5. \nWe didn't double-count anything, so there was no correction to make. \nHere are a few more pretty obvious rules for probability measures, which follow logically from the first 3: \n4. Pr() = 0 \n5. Pr(A) = 1 -Pr(A) (recall the \"total complement\" operator     from p. 18.) \n6. Pr(A) <= Pr(B) if A  B \nFinally, let me draw attention to a common special case of the above rules, which is the situation in which all outcomes are equally likely. This usually happens when we roll dice, flip coins, deal cards, _etc._ since the probability of rolling a 3 is (normally) the same as rolling a 6, and the probability of being dealt the 10 is the same as the Q. It may also happen when we generate encryption keys, choose between alternate network routing paths, or determine the initial positions of baddies in a first-person shooter level. \nIn this case, if there are N possible outcomes (note N = |ohm|) then the probability of any event A is: \n Pr(A) = |A| N . \n66 CHAPTER 4. PROBABILITY \nIt's the size (cardinality) of the event set that matters, and the ratio of this number to the total number of events is the probability. For example, if we deal a card from a fair deck, the probability of drawing a face card is \n Pr(F ) = \n |F | N \n = |{K, K, K, * * * , J}| 52 \n = 12 52 = \n. 231. \nPlease realize that this shortcut _only_ applies when the probability of each outcome is the same. We certainly couldn't say, for example, that the probability of a user's password starting with the letter q is just 261 , because passwords surely don't contain all letters with equal frequency. (At least, I'd be very surprised if that were the case.) The only way to solve a problem like this is to know how often each letter of the alphabet occurs. \n**4.3 Philosophical interlude** \nWhich brings me to an important question. How do we get these probability numbers, anyway? Everything so far has assumed that the numbers have been dropped into our lap. \nThe answer depends somewhat on your interpretation of what probability _means_. If we say \"the probability of getting heads on a coin flip is .5,\" what are we really saying? There have traditionally been two opposing answers to this question, called the **frequentist** view and the **Bayesian** view. It's interesting to compare their claims. \nThe frequentist view is that we derive probabilities by simply running many trials, and counting the results. The proportions of various outcomes yield a good idea of their probabilities, particularly if the sample size is large. Consider flipping a coin. If we flip a coin ten times and count three heads, we might not have a great \n4.3. PHILOSOPHICAL INTERLUDE 67 \nidea of how often heads will occur in the long run. But if we flip it a million times and get 500,372 heads, we can confidently say that the probability of getting a head on a single flip is approximately .500. \nThis much isn't controversial: it's more like common sense. But the frequentist philosophy states that this is really the _only_ way that probability can be defined. It's what probability _is_ : the frequency with which we can expect certain outcomes to occur, based on our observations of their past behavior. Probabilities only make sense for things that are repeatable, and reflect a known, reliable trend in how often they produce certain results. Historical proponents of this philosophy include John Venn, the inventor of the aforementioned Venn diagram, and Ronald Fisher, one of the greatest biologists and statisticians of all time. \nIf frequentism is thus on a quest for experimental objectivity, Bayesianism might be called \"subjective.\" This isn't to say it's arbitrary or sloppy. It simply has a different notion of what probability ultimately means. Bayesians interpret probability as a quantitative personal assessment of the likelihood of something happening. They point out that for many (most) events of interest, trials are neither possible nor sensible. Suppose I'm considering asking a girl out to the prom, and I'm trying to estimate how likely it is she'll go with me. It's not like I'm going to ask her a hundred times and count how many times she says yes, then divide by 100 to get a probability. There is in fact no way to perform a trial or use past data to guide me, and at any rate she's only going to say yes or no once. So based on my background knowledge and my assumptions about her, myself, and the world, I form an opinion which could be quantified as a \"percent chance.\" \nOnce I've formed this opinion (which of course involves guesswork and subjectivity) I can then reason about it mathematically, using all the tools we've been developing. Of special interest to Bayesians is the notion of _updating_ probabilities when new information comes to light, a topic we'll return to in a moment. For the Bayesian, the probability of some hypothesis being true is between 0 and 1, and when an agent (a human, or a bot) makes decisions, he/she/it \n68 CHAPTER 4. PROBABILITY \ndoes so on the most up-to-date information he/she/it has, always revising beliefs in various hypotheses when confirming or refuting evidence is encountered. Famous Bayesians include Pierre-Simon Laplace, sometimes called \"the French Isaac Newton\" for his scientific brilliance, and 18 th^ century theologian Thomas Bayes, for whom the theory is named. \nI won't try to conceal that my own thinking on this topic is pretty Bayesian. But I find this whole topic fascinating because it shows how brilliant people, who unanimously agree on the rules and equations, can have such radically different interpretations of what it all means. \n**4.4 Conditional probability** \nI mentioned that Bayesians are especially concerned with the idea of revising estimates about probability based on new information that may come to light. This notion can be crystallized in the idea of **conditional probability**. When we talk about the conditional probability of an event A, we mean \"what's the probability that A occurs, _given_ that I know some other event K has also occurred?\" Think of K as \"background knowledge\": it's additional information which, when known, may influence how likely we think A is to have occurred. It can be mathematically computed as follows: \n Pr(A|K) = \n Pr(A  K) Pr(K) \nWe pronounce Pr(A|K) as \"the probability of A given K.\" It is the conditional probability of A, or \"the probability of A conditioned on K.\" We'll sometimes call plain old Pr(A) the **_a priori_** **probability** , or the **prior** probability if we don't want to sound Latin. The prior is simply the original unadjusted probability, if we aren't privy to the background information K. \nLet's go back to _American Idol_. We know that the probability of an underage winner is only .4, because U = { Kelly, Fantasia }, and we estimate that each of them has a .2 probability of winning. So it seems more likely than not that our winner will be over 21. But \n4.4. CONDITIONAL PROBABILITY 69 \nwait: suppose we had some additional information. Just before the outcome is announced, news is leaked through a Rupert Murdoch news source that the winner is a _woman_! If we believe this reporter, does that change our expectation about how old the winner is likely to be? \nIndeed it does. Knowing that the winner is female eliminates Dave from consideration. Looking back at Figure 4.1, we can see that once we know Dave is out of the running, the remaining pool consists of just F , which includes Kelly, Fantasia, and Carrie. The question is, how do we update our probability from .4 to reflect the fact that only these three ladies are left? \nIn this case F is the background knowledge: we know that the event F has occurred. And we want to know how likely U is to also have occurred. This is found easily: \n Pr(U |F ) = Pr(U  F ) Pr(F ) \n = \n Pr({Kelly,Fantasia}) Pr({Kelly,Fantasia,Carrie}) = \n. 4 .5 = \n. 8. \nOur estimated chance of an underage winner doubled once we found out she was female (even though we don't yet know _which_ female). \nIf you stare at the equation and diagram, you'll see the rationale for this formula. Kelly and Fantasia originally had only .4 of the entire probability between them. But once David was axed, the question became: \"what percentage of the _remaining_ probability do Kelly and Fantasia have?\" The answer was no longer .4 out of 1, but .4 out of .5, since only .5 of the whole was left post-David. This is why we divided by Pr(F ): that's what we know remains given our background fact. \nNow in this case, the conditional probability was higher than the original probability. Could it ever be lower? Easily. Consider the probability of a rock-star winner, Pr(R). _A priori_ , it's .7. But \n70 CHAPTER 4. PROBABILITY \nagain, let's say we had information leaked to us that the winner, whoever she may be, is female. We can now update our estimate: \n Pr(R|F ) = \n Pr(R  F ) Pr(F ) \n = Pr({Kelly}) Pr({Kelly,Fantasia,Carrie}) = \n. 2 .5 = \n. 4. \nYou see, once we find out that David is no longer a possibility, our only remaining hope for a rock star is Kelly. And she has only 40% of the probability that's left over. Note that this is a higher chance for her personally -- she's got to be excited by the press leak -- but it's lower for _rock stars_ , of which she is only one (and evidently, not the predicted strongest). \nBackground knowledge can even peg our probability estimate to an extreme: all the way to 0, or to 1. What's Pr(U |C), the probability of an underage winner, given that he/she is a country singer? The intersection of U and C is zero, so this makes Pr(U |C) = 0. In words: a country winner eliminates any possibility of an underage winner. And what's Pr(F |U ), the probability that a woman wins, given that we know the winner to be underage? Well, F  U and U are the same (check me), so Pr Pr(F(^ U U) ) =..^44 = 1. Therefore, an underage winner guarantees a female winner. \nThe way I think about conditional probability is this: look at the diagram, consider the events known to have occurred, and then _mentally block out everything except that._ Once we know the background fact(s), we're essentially dealing with a restricted world. Take the example of the known female winner. Once we know that event F in fact occurred, we can visually filter out David, and look at the F blob as though that were our entire world. In this restricted female-only view, the underage elements comprise a greater percentage of the total than they did before. And half of the rock-star elements have now been obscured, leaving only Kelly as the one-of-the-remaining-three. \n4.5. TOTAL PROBABILITY 71 \nMany psychologists, by the way, claim that we're constantly doing this sort of thing in our minds: gathering facts, then revising our beliefs about the world in light of those facts.

Each element of the set D = {d 1 , d 2 , d 3 } = { 1 , 3 , 4 } is the index of a variable.

More precisely, for each possible choice of values for the independent variables we get exactly one set of values for the dependent variables that combine to form a solution of the system.

This systematic approach to solving a system of equations will allow us to create a precise description of the solution set for any consistent system once we have found the reduced row-echelon form of the augmented matrix. It will work just as well when the set of free variables is empty and we get just a single solution. And we could program a computer to do it! Now have a whack at Archetype J (Exercise TSS.C10), mimicking the discussion in this example. We'll still be here when you get back. 4 \nUsing the reduced row-echelon form of the augmented matrix of a system of equations to determine the nature of the solution set of the system is a very key idea. So let us look at one more example like the last one. But first a definition, and then the example. We mix our metaphors a bit when we call variables free versus dependent. Maybe we should call dependent variables \"enslaved\"? \nDefinition IDV Independent and Dependent Variables Suppose A is the augmented matrix of a consistent system of linear equations and B is a row-equivalent matrix in reduced row-echelon form. Suppose j is the index of a pivot column of B. Then the variable xj is dependent. A variable that is not dependent is called independent or free. \u0003 \nIf you studied this definition carefully, you might wonder what to do if the system has n variables and column n + 1 is a pivot column? We will see shortly, by Theorem RCLS, that this never happens for a consistent system. \nExample FDV Free and dependent variables Consider the system of five equations in five variables, \n x 1 - x 2 - 2 x 3 + x 4 + 11x 5 = 13 x 1 - x 2 + x 3 + x 4 + 5x 5 = 16 2 x 1 - 2 x 2 + x 4 + 10x 5 = 21 2 x 1 - 2 x 2 - x 3 + 3x 4 + 20x 5 = 38 2 x 1 - 2 x 2 + x 3 + x 4 + 8x 5 = 22 \nwhose augmented matrix row-reduces to       1 - 1 0 0 3 6 0 0 1 0 - 2 1 0 0 0 1 4 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n       \nColumns 1, 3 and 4 are pivot columns, so D = { 1 , 3 , 4 }. From this we know that the variables x 1 , x 3 and x 4 will be dependent variables, and each of the r = 3 nonzero rows of the row-reduced matrix will yield an expression for one of these \n SST S S B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 39 \n three variables. The set F is all the remaining column indices, F = { 2 , 5 , 6 }. The column index 6 in F means that the final column is not a pivot column, and thus the system is consistent (Theorem RCLS). The remaining indices in F indicate free variables, so x 2 and x 5 (the remaining variables) are our free variables. The resulting three equations that describe our solution set are then, (xd 1 = x 1 ) x 1 = 6 + x 2 - 3 x 5 (xd 2 = x 3 ) x 3 = 1 + 2x 5 (xd 3 = x 4 ) x 4 = 9 - 4 x 5 Make sure you understand where these three equations came from, and notice how the location of the pivot columns determined the variables on the left-hand side of each equation. We can compactly describe the solution set as, \n S = \n    \n   \n      \n 6 + x 2 - 3 x 5 x 2 1 + 2x 5 9 - 4 x 5 x 5 \n      \n | | | | | | | | | \n x 2 , x 5  C \n    \n   \nNotice how we express the freedom for x 2 and x 5 : x 2 , x 5  C. 4 Sets are an important part of algebra, and we have seen a few already. Being comfortable with sets is important for understanding and writing proofs. If you have not already, pay a visit now to Section SET. We can now use the values of m, n, r, and the independent and dependent variables to categorize the solution sets for linear systems through a sequence of theorems. Through the following sequence of proofs, you will want to consult three proof techniques. See Proof Technique E, Proof Technique N, Proof Technique CP. First we have an important theorem that explores the distinction between consistent and inconsistent linear systems. Theorem RCLS Recognizing Consistency of a Linear System Suppose A is the augmented matrix of a system of linear equations with n variables. Suppose also that B is a row-equivalent matrix in reduced row-echelon form with r nonzero rows. Then the system of equations is inconsistent if and only if column n + 1 of B is a pivot column. \n Proof. (=) The first half of the proof begins with the assumption that column n + 1 of B is a pivot column. Then the leading 1 of row r is located in column n + 1 of B and so row r of B begins with n consecutive zeros, finishing with the leading 1. This is a representation of the equation 0 = 1, which is false. Since this equation is false for any collection of values we might choose for the variables, there are no solutions for the system of equations, and the system is inconsistent. (=) For the second half of the proof, we wish to show that if we assume the system is inconsistent, then column n + 1 of B is a pivot column. But instead of proving this directly, we will form the logically equivalent statement that is the contrapositive, and prove that instead (see Proof Technique CP). Turning the implication around, and negating each portion, we arrive at the logically equivalent statement: if column n + 1 of B is not a pivot column, then the system of equations is consistent. If column n + 1 of B is not a pivot column, the leading 1 for row r is located somewhere in columns 1 through n. Then every preceding row's leading 1 is also located in columns 1 through n. In other words, since the last leading 1 is not in the last column, no leading 1 for any row is in the last column, due to the echelon layout of the leading 1's (Definition RREF). We will now construct a solution to the system by setting each dependent variable to the entry of the final column in the row with the corresponding leading 1, and setting each free variable to zero. That \n SST S S B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 40 \nsentence is pretty vague, so let us be more precise. Using our notation for the sets D and F from the reduced row-echelon form (Definition RREF): xdi = [B]i,n+1 , 1 <= i <= r xfi = 0, 1 <= i <= n - r These values for the variables make the equations represented by the first r rows of B all true (convince yourself of this). Rows numbered greater than r (if any) are all zero rows, hence represent the equation 0 = 0 and are also all true. We have now identified one solution to the system represented by B, and hence a solution to the system represented by A (Theorem REMES). So we can say the system is consistent (Definition CS). \u0004 \nThe beauty of this theorem being an equivalence is that we can unequivocally test to see if a system is consistent or inconsistent by looking at just a single entry of the reduced row-echelon form matrix. We could program a computer to do it! Notice that for a consistent system the row-reduced augmented matrix has n + 1  F , so the largest element of F does not refer to a variable. Also, for an inconsistent system, n + 1  D, and it then does not make much sense to discuss whether or not variables </passage>\n\n<|assistant|>\n", "prediction": "Can you help me extract queries from the following passage <passage> RREFU),     \n 1 4 0 0 2 1 - 3 4 0 0 1 0 1 - 3 5 2 0 0 0 1 2 - 6 6 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n     \nSo we find that r = 3 and D = {d 1, d 2, d 3 } = { 1, 3, 4 } F = {f 1, f 2, f 3, f 4, f 5 } = { 2, 5, 6, 7, 8 } Let i denote any one of the r = 3 nonzero rows.

Frequently, the students who entered college best prepared were those who were already middle or upper class, meaning the opportunities the workingand lower-class students received were more limited (Armstrong and Hamilton 1-26). When you look at this alongside what Gloria Ladson-Billings calls the _educational debt_ , or the compounded impact of educational deficits that grow across generations of poor minority students, literacy efforts as they are currently framed paint a bleak picture for poor minority students (3-12). The issue is not just one of unequal access to opportunities. Jacqueline Jones Royster and Carmen Kynard illustrate how attitudes toward students as writers are interwoven with attitudes toward them as people. Language cannot be disassociated from people, which has important consequences for those who grow up speaking different dialects. By continuing to propagate the notion of correct and incorrect ways of speaking, we effectively devalue the intelligence and character of students, employees, and colleagues who, for whatever reasons, don't speak or write what in historical terms has been called the King's English (among other names). We use the perception of improper communication as evidence of others' lesser character or ability, despite recognizing that this country was united (if only in name) after declaring independence from that king (Kynard; Royster). This perception becomes all the more problematic because it is about not just devaluing individuals but the widespread practice of devaluing the literate practices of those who are already marginalized. David Gold highlights how the literacy of African Americans, women, and working-class and rural people has been marginalized in our understanding of writing. Gold writes about how the literacy practices of African Americans in universities laid the groundwork for the civil rights movement. Indeed, the schools he studied were decades ahead of the larger national conversation on how literacy, identity, and power were interrelated. In her work examining how literacy and identity formation were key for African American women and for social change, Jacqueline Jones Royster discusses the importance of understanding these cultural, identity, and social movements, echoing the impact marginalized scholars had A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 18 \nin academia. Both demonstrate the detrimental impact of sidelining groups of people and their literate practices by devaluing their languages and their experiences, not just for those who are marginalized but for our larger understanding of how we as a society write. The notion of one correct way of writing is also troubling because it operates under the assumption that linguistic differences are the result of error. The reality is that for many speakers, what we might perceive as a mistake is actually a system of difference. One notable example of a different dialect of English is Ebonics, which has different patterns of speech rooted in the ancestral heritage of its speakers. Similarly, immigrant groups will frequently speak and write English in a way that mirrors the linguistic heritage of their mother tongue. The way that we conceptualize language is not just detrimental to minorities; it also devalues the identities that workingand lower-class people bring to communicative situations, including the classroom. Lynn Z. Bloom writes that \"Freshman Composition is an unabashedly middle-class enterprise.\" She argues that one of the reasons composition is required for all students is because it promulgates middle-class values and ways of thinking. These values in the writing classroom are embodied in everything from the notion of property, which undergirds the way that plagiarism and intellectual property are treated, to the formality of language and rhetorical choices that are encouraged in papers (654-675). Indeed, the way many instructors teach writing, plagiarism, citation, and word choice in papers is not in and of itself good but rather is the socially accepted way of interacting with text as defined by the middle class. Mike Rose and Irvin Peckham often write about the tension of middle-class values on working-class students and the cognitive dissonance and struggles with identity that come with imposing such values in writing under the guise of correctness. The idea that there is one correct way of writing devalues the writing, thoughts, intelligence, and identities of people from lower-class backgrounds. Pragmatically, many argue that standard English should be dominant in the binary between academic English and all other dialects in order for speakers and writers to communicate with credibility in their communities. This argument has been used to justify the continued attention to correctness at the expense of authors' voices, but we can teach people to adapt while also valuing their identities. We can talk about writing as something that they can employ to their benefit rather than a hegemonic standard that supersedes their backgrounds, identities, and experiences. In order to value the diversity of communication and identities that exist in the US, we need to start teaching and envisioning writing as a cultural and social activity. We need a more nuanced view of writing in society that encourages everyone to adapt to their audiences and contexts rather than placing an undue burden on those who do not fit the mold of standard English. One strategy for teaching academic English without devaluing a writer's identity is codeswitching, a concept already taught in schools with significant minority populations as a way of empowering young people. While instruction in code-switching is valuable because it teaches students that they can adopt different linguistic choices to appeal to different audiences, it is deeply problematic that the impetus is still placed on minority students with nonstandard dialects to adapt. While code-switching is meant to empower people, it is still rooted in the mentality that there is one correct way of writing, because even as code-switching teaches an incredibly nuanced way of thinking about writing, it is still being taught in the context 19 COLLECTED WORKS \nof preparing writers to deal with a society that will use errors in speaking as evidence that they are lesser. As a result, it is a less-than-ideal solution because it plays into--rather than undermines--the racism of academic English. By perpetuating the myth of one correct way of writing, we are effectively marginalizing substantial swaths of the population linguistically and culturally. The first step in combating this is as easy as recognizing how correctness reinforces inequality and affects our own perceptions of people and questioning our assumptions about communication, and a second step is valuing code-switching in a wide swath of communicative situations. The original chapter, _There Is One Correct Way of Writing and Speaking_ by Anjali Pattanayak, is from Bad Ideas about Writing \n**1.** What new ideas were here for you to consider? In what ways did this     chapter challenge your way of thinking? \n**2.** Pattanayak suggests that one way to address students' different     backgrounds and dialects is to incorporate more explicit discussion about     code-switching in the classroom. Is this a satisfying solution? Why or why     not? What are the benefits or problems with this approach? \n**3.** Is it possible to be true to your own voice and also succeed in academia?     What might that look like? Is that option more available to some students     than others? \n#### DISCUSSION QUESTIONS \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 20 \n**1.** Freewrite about the different \"code-switching\" spaces in your own life.     How do you speak differently in different contexts? How does it feel to     shift back and forth between those voices? \n**2.** Research the term \"code-switching\" and learn more about who is under the     most pressure to code-switch and why. How does this add to your     understanding of Pattanayak's argument? What might be problematic     about using the term to describe other kinds of language adjustment in the     classroom? \n#### ACTIVITIES \n21 COLLECTED WORKS \n**1.** While the notion of what constitutes academic English has remained     relatively static in popular culture, the reality of writing in the university     has broadened to include many other types of writing. Patricia Bizzell,     Helen Fox, and Christopher Shroeder compile arguments for addressing     these other types of communication in _Alt Dis: Alternative Discourses and the_     _Academy_. \n**2.** In _College Writing and Beyond_ , Anne Beaufort provides a framework in     which to understand how writing is dynamic. In her article \"Freshman     Composition as a Middle-Class Enterprise,\" Lynn Z. Bloom articulates the     ways in which the cultural values of the middle class are being taught in the     writing classroom as objectively good or true and the impact of this     mentality. Additionally, Asao Inoue compiles a collection of articles in _Race_     _and Writing Assessment_ that provides frameworks for considering race in     assessment practices. \n**3.** In 1974, the Conference for College Composition and Communication     passed the resolution _Students' Right to Their Own Language_. In the time     since it passed, there has been a great deal of discussion around the     wisdom of that resolution. Editors Austin Jackson, David E. Kirkland, and     Staci Perryman-Clark compile short articles for and against this resolution. \n**4.** Bruce Horner, Min-Zhan Lu, Jacqueline Jones Royster, and John Trimbur     write about how the increasing number of English speakers in the world is     increasing linguistic diversity in \"Opinion: Language Difference in Writing:     Toward a Translingual Approach.\" Additionally, Irvin Peckham writes     extensively with a focus on working-class students in the classroom and     the impact of college and academic writing as a middle-class enterprise in     \"The Stories We Tell.\" For more on the history and cultural development of     African American Vernacular English, consider _Beyond Ebonics: Linguistic_     _Pride and Racial Prejudice_ by John Baugh. \n#### ADDITIONAL RESOURCES \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 22 \n Armstrong, Elizabeth A., and Laura T.

What I normally do just isn't working!\" That's a familiar feeling for all writers. Sometimes the writing just seems to flow as if by magic, but then the flow stops cold. Your brain seems to have run out of things to say. If you just wait for the magic to come back, you might wait a long time. What professional writers know is that writing takes consistent effort. Writing comes out of a regular practice--a habit. Professional writers also know that not everything they write ends up in the final draft. Sometimes we have to write what Anne Lamott calls a \"shitty first draft.\" One of my favorite writing professors, Duncan Carter, used to say that he was a terrible writer but a great reviser, and that's what helped him write when inspiration wasn't available. So how do writers get going when they feel stuck or uninspired? They develop a set of habits and have more than one way to write to get the words flowing again. You might associate the idea of writing anxiety or writer's block with procrastination, and procrastination certainly can be either a cause or an effect of writing anxiety. But writing anxiety or writer's block is more of a condition or state of being. We'll start by defining the term--so that you can figure out if you have it--and then cover some ways to work through it. Do you worry excessively about writing assignments? Do they make you feel uneasy or agitated? Do you have negative feelings about certain types of writing? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you might be dealing with writing anxiety. Writing anxiety simply means that a writer is experiencing negative feelings about a given writing task. Writing anxiety is often more about the audience and/or purpose for a given writing task than it is about the mere act of writing itself. Say you just bought a new pair of headphones. You brought them home, removed all the packaging, and connected them to your phone, and they're \n#### WHAT IS WRITING ANXIETY AND HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE IT? \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 24 \n amazing! So you decide to visit the company website, and you write a stellar review of the product, giving it a five-star rating and including descriptive details about the headphones' comfortable fit, excellent sound quality, ability to cancel outside noise, and reasonable price.
