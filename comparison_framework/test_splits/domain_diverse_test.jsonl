For now, just realize that every set is either finite or infinite. \nYou might think, by the way, that there's no way to define an infinite set extensionally, since that would require infinite paper. This isn't true, though, if we creatively use an ellipsis: \n I = { 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 ,... } \nThis is an extensional definition of I, since we're explicitly listing all the members. It could be argued, though, that it's really intensional, since the interpretation of \"... \" requires the reader to \n2.4. SETS ARE NOT ARRAYS 13 \nfigure out the rule and mentally apply it to all remaining numbers. Perhaps in reality we are giving an intensional definition, cloaked in an extensional-looking list of members. I'm on the fence here. \n**2.4 Sets are not arrays** \nIf you've done some computer programming, you might see a resemblance between sets and the collections of items often used in a program: arrays, perhaps, or linked lists. To be sure, there are some similarities. But there are also some very important differences, which must not be overlooked: \n- **No order.** As previously mentioned, there is no order to the     members of a set. \"{Dad, Mom}\" is the same set as \"{Mom,     Dad}\". In a computer program, of course, most arrays or lists     have first, second, and last elements, and an index number     assigned to each. \n- **No duplicates.** Suppose M is the set of all males. What     would it possibly mean to say M = {T.J., T.J., Johnny}?     Would that mean that \"T.J. is twice the man that Johnny     is\"? This is obviously nonsensical. The set M is based on a     property: maleness. Each element of ohm is either male, or it     isn't. It can't be \"male three times.\" Again, in an array or     linked list, you could certainly have more than one copy of     the same item in different positions. \n- **Infinite sets.** 'Nuff said. I've never seen an array with in-     finitely many elements, and neither will you. \n- **Untyped.** Most of the time, an array or other collection in a     computer program contains elements of only a single _type_ : it's     an array of integers, or a linked list of Customer objects, for     example. This is important because the program often needs     to treat all elements in the collection the same way. Perhaps     it needs to loop over the array to add up all the numbers,     or iterate through a customer list and search for customers     who have not placed an order in the last six months. The \n14 CHAPTER 2. SETS \n program would run into problems if it tried to add a string of text to its cumulative total, or encountered a Product object in the middle of its list of Customers. Sets, though, can be heterogeneous , meaning they can contain different kinds of things. The Davies family example had all human beings, but nothing stops me from creating a set X = { Jack Nicholson, Kim Kardashian, Universal Studios, 5786,  }. I don't press this point too hard for a couple of reasons. First, most programming languages do allow heterogeneous collections of some sort, even if they're not the most natural thing to express. In Java, you can define an ArrayList as a nongeneric so that it simply holds items of class \"Object.\" In C, you can have an array of void *'s -- pointers to some unspecified type -- which allows your array to point to different kinds of things. Unless it's a loosely-typed language, though (like Perl or JavaScript), it sort of feels like you're bending over backwards to do this. The other reason I make this distinction lightly is that when we're dealing with sets, we often do find it useful to deal with things of only one type, and so our ohm ends up being homogeneous anyway. \nPerhaps the biggest thing to remember here is that a set is a purely abstract concept, whereas an array is a concrete, tangible, explicit list. When we talk about sets, we're reasoning in general about large conceptual things, whereas when we deal with arrays, we're normally iterating through them for some specific purpose. You can't iterate through a set very easily because (1) there's no order to the members, and (2) there might well be infinitely many of them anyway. \n**2.5 Sets are not ordered pairs (or tuples)** \nYou'll remember from high school algebra the notion of an **ordered pair** (x, y). We dealt with those when we wanted to specify a point to plot on a graph: the first coordinate gave the distance from the origin on the x-axis, and the second coordinate on the y-axis. Clearly an ordered pair is not a set, because as the name implies it is \n2.6. SETS OF SETS 15 \nordered: (3, -4) 6 = (- 4 , 3). For this reason, we'll be very careful to use curly braces to denote sets, and parentheses to denote ordered pairs. \nBy the way, although the word \"coordinate\" is often used to describe the elements of an ordered pair, that's really a geometrycentric word that implies a visual plot of some kind. Normally we won't be plotting elements like that, but we will still have use to deal with ordered pairs. I'll just call the constituent parts \"elements\" to make it more general. \nThree-dimensional points need **ordered triple** s (x, y, z), and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to deduce that we could extend this to any number of elements. The question is what to call them, and you _do_ sort of sound like a rocket scientist (or other generic nerd) when you say **tuple**. (Some people rhyme this word with \"Drupal,\" and others with \"couple,\" by the way, and there seems to be no consensus). If you have an ordered-pair-type thing with 5 elements, therefore, it's a 5-tuple (or a quintuple). If it has 117 elements, it's a 117-tuple, and there's really nothing else to call it. The general term (if we don't know or want to specify how many elements) is **n-tuple**. In any case, it's an ordered sequence of elements that may contain duplicates, so it's very different than a set. \n**2.6 Sets of sets** \nSets are heterogeneous -- a single set can contain four universities, seven integers, and an ahi tuna -- and so it might occur to you that they can contain other _sets_ as well. This is indeed true, but let me issue a stern warning: you can get in deep water very quickly when you start thinking about \"sets of sets.\" In 1901, in fact, the philosopher Bertrand Russell pointed out that this idea can lead to unresolvable contradictions unless you put some constraints on it. What became known as \"Russell's Paradox\" famously goes as follows: consider the set R of all sets that do _not_ have themselves \n16 CHAPTER 2. SETS \nas members^3. Now is R a member of itself, or isn't it? Either way you answer turns out to be wrong (try it!) which means that this whole setup must be flawed at some level. \nThe good news is that as long as you don't deal with this kind of self-referential loop (\"containing yourself as a member\") then it's pretty safe to try at home. Consider this set: \n V = { 3 , 5 , { 5 , 4 }, 2 }. \nThis set has _four_ (not five) members. Three of V 's members are integers: 2, 3, and 5. The other one is a set (with no name given). That other set, by the way, has two members of its own: 4 and 5. If you were asked, \"is 4  V \"? the answer would be _no_. \nAs a corollary to this, there's a difference between \n  \nand {  }. \nThe former is a set with no elements. The latter is a set with _one_ element: and that element just happens to be a set with nothing in it. \n**2.7 Cardinality** \nWhen we talk about the number of elements in a set, we use the word **cardinality**. You'd think we could just call it the \"size\" of the set, but mathematicians sometimes like words that sound cool. The cardinality of M (the set of males, where the Davies family is the domain of discourse) is 3, because there are three elements in it. The cardinality of the empty set  is 0. The cardinality of the set of all integers is . Simple as that. \n(^3) For instance, the set Z of all zebras is a member of R, since Z itself is a set (not a zebra) and so Z / Z. The set S, on the other hand, defined as \"the set of all sets mentioned in this book,\" is _not_ a member of R, since S contains itself as a member. \n2.8. SOME SPECIAL SETS 17 \nThe notation we use for cardinality is vertical bars, like with absolute value. So we write: |M | = 3. \nTo restate the example immediately above, || = 0, but |{}| = 1. \n**2.8 Some special sets** \nIn addition to the empty set, there are symbols for some other common sets, including: \n- Z -- the integers (positive, negative, and zero) \n- N -- the natural numbers (positive integers and zero) \n- Q -- the rational numbers (all numbers that can be expressed     as an integer divided by another integer) \n- R -- the real numbers (all numbers that aren't imaginary,     even decimal numbers that aren't rational) \nThe cardinality of all these sets is infinity, although as I alluded to previously, |R| is in some sense \"greater than\" |N|. For the curious, we say that N is a **countably infinite** set, whereas |R| is **uncountably infinite**. Speaking very loosely, this can be thought of this way: if we start counting up all the natural numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,... , we will never get to the end of them. But _at least we can start counting_. With the real numbers, we can't even get off the ground. Where do you begin? Starting with 0 is fine, but then what's the \"next\" real number? Choosing anything for your second number inevitably skips a lot in between. Once you've digested this, I'll spring another shocking truth on you: |Q| is actually _equal_ to |N|, not greater than it as |R| is. Cantor came up with an ingenious numbering scheme whereby all the rational numbers -- including 3, - 9 , 174 , and - 151729 -- can be listed off regularly, in order, just like the integers can. And so |Q| = |N| 6 = |R|. This kind of stuff can blow your mind. \n18 CHAPTER 2. SETS \n**2.9 Combining sets** \nOkay, so we have sets. Now what can we do with them? When you first learn about numbers back before kindergarten, the next thing you learn is how to combine numbers using various operations to produce other numbers. These include +, -, x, /, exponents, roots, _etc._ Sets, too, have operations that are useful for combining to make other sets. These include: \n- **Union** (). The union of two sets is a set that includes the     elements that _either (or both)_ of them have as members. For     instance, if A = { Dad, Lizzy }, and B = { Lizzy, T.J., Johnny     }, then A  B = { Dad, Lizzy, T.J., Johnny }. Note that an     element is in the union if it is in A _or_ B. For this reason,     there is a strong relationship between the union operator of     sets and the \"or\" () operator of boolean logic that we'll see     later. \n- **Intersection** (). The intersection of two sets is a set that     includes the elements that _both_ of them have as members. In     the above example, A  B = { Lizzy }. There is a strong     connection between intersection and the \"and\" () boolean     logic operator. \n- **(Partial) complement** (-). Looks like subtraction, but sig-     nificantly different. A - B contains _the elements from A that_     _are not also in B_. So you start with A, and then \"subtract off\"     the contents of B, if they occur. In the above example, A - B     = { Dad }. (Note that T.J. and Johnny didn't really enter in     to the calculation.) Unlike  and , - is not **commutative**.     This means it's not symmetrical: A - B doesn't (normally)     give the same answer as B - A. In this example, B - A is     { T.J., Johnny }, whereas if you ever reverse the operands     with union or intersection, you'll always get the same result     as before. \n- **(Total) complement** (X). Same as the partial complement,     above, except that the implied first operand is ohm. In other     words, A-B is \"all the things in A that aren't in B,\" whereas \n2.9.

There are four steps in the proof, and the first three are about showing that B and C have the same number of pivot columns, in the same places. In other words, the \"primed\" symbols are a necessary fiction. First Step. Suppose that d 1 < d' 1. Then 1 = [B] 1 d 1 Definition RREF \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n d 1 k [C]kd 1 \nSSR R E F B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 27 \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n d 1 k(0) d 1 < d' 1 \n = 0 \nThe entries of C are all zero since they are left and below of the leading 1 in row 1 and column d' 1 of C. This is a contradiction, so we know that d 1 >= d' 1. By an entirely similar argument, reversing the roles of B and C, we could conclude that d 1 <= d' 1. Together this means that d 1 = d' 1. Second Step. Suppose that we have determined that d 1 = d' 1 , d 2 = d' 2 , d 3 = d' 3 , \n... dp = d' p. Let us now show that dp+1 = d' p+1. Working towards a contradiction, suppose that dp+1 < d' p+1. For 1 <= ` <= p, \n 0 = [B]p+1,d Definition RREF \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n dp+1,k [C]kd \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n dp+1,k [C]kd'  \n = dp+1, [C]d'  + \n ^ m \n k=1 k 6 = \n dp+1,k [C]kd'  Property CACN \n = dp+1,(1) + \n ^ m \n k k=1 6 = \n dp+1,k(0) Definition RREF \n = dp+1, \nNow, \n 1 = [B]p+1,dp+1 Definition RREF \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n dp+1,k [C]kdp+1 \n = \n ^ p \n k=1 \n dp+1,k [C]kdp+1 + \n ^ m \n k=p+1 \n dp+1,k [C]kdp+1 Property AACN \n = \n ^ p \n k=1 \n (0) [C]kdp+1 + \n ^ m \n k=p+1 \n dp+1,k [C]kdp+1 \n = \n ^ m \n k=p+1 \n dp+1,k [C]kdp+1 \n = \n ^ m \n k=p+1 \n dp+1,k(0) dp+1 < d' p+1 \n = 0 \nThis contradiction shows that dp+1 >= d' p+1. By an entirely similar argument, we could conclude that dp+1 <= d' p+1, and therefore dp+1 = d' p+1. Third Step. Now we establish that r = r'. Suppose that r'^ < r. By the arguments above, we know that d 1 = d' 1 , d 2 = d' 2 , d 3 = d' 3 ,... , dr'^ = d' r'. For 1 <= ` <= r'^ < r, \n 0 = [B]rd Definition RREF \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n drk [C]kd \nSSR R E F B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 28 \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kd + \n ^ m \n k=r'^ +1 \n drk [C]kd Property AACN \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kd + \n ^ m \n k=r'^ +1 \n drk(0) Property AACN \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kd \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kd'  \n = dr [C]d'  + \n ^ r' \n k=1 k 6 = \n drk [C]kd'  Property CACN \n = dr(1) + \n ^ r' \n k=1 k 6 = \n drk(0) Definition RREF \n = dr \nNow examine the entries of row r of B, \n [B]rj = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n drk [C]kj \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kj + \n ^ m \n k=r'^ +1 \n drk [C]kj Property CACN \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kj + \n ^ m \n k=r'^ +1 \n drk(0) Definition RREF \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kj \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n (0) [C]kj \n = 0 \nSo row r is a totally zero row, contradicting that this should be the bottommost nonzero row of B. So r'^ >= r. By an entirely similar argument, reversing the roles of B and C, we would conclude that r'^ <= r and therefore r = r'. Thus, combining the first three steps we can say that D = D'. In other words, B and C have the same pivot columns, in the same locations. Fourth Step. In this final step, we will not argue by contradiction. Our intent is to determine the values of the dij. Notice that we can use the values of the di interchangeably for B and C. Here we go, \n 1 = [B]idi Definition RREF \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n dik [C]kdi \n = dii [C]idi + \n ^ m \n k=1 k 6 =i \n dik [C]kdi Property CACN \nSSR R E F B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 29 \n = dii(1) + \n ^ m \n k=1 k 6 =i \n dik(0) Definition RREF \n = dii \nand for ` 6 = i \n 0 = [B]id Definition RREF \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n dik [C]kd \n = di [C]d + \n ^ m \n k=1 k 6 = \n dik [C]kd Property CACN \n = di(1) + \n ^ m \n k=1 k 6 = \n dik(0) Definition RREF \n = di \nFinally, having determined the values of the dij , we can show that B = C. For 1 <= i <= m, 1 <= j <= n, \n [B]ij = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n dik [C]kj \n = dii [C]ij + \n ^ m \n k=1 k 6 =i \n dik [C]kj Property CACN \n = (1) [C]ij + \n ^ m \n k k=1 6 =i \n (0) [C]kj \n = [C]ij \nSo B and C have equal values in every entry, and so are the same matrix. \u0004 \nWe will now run through some examples of using these definitions and theorems to solve some systems of equations. From now on, when we have a matrix in reduced row-echelon form, we will mark the leading 1's with a small box. This will help you count, and identify, the pivot columns. In your work, you can box 'em, circle 'em or write 'em in a different color -- just identify 'em somehow. This device will prove very useful later and is a very good habit to start developing right now. \nExample SAB Solutions for Archetype B Let us find the solutions to the following system of equations, \n - 7 x 1 - 6 x 2 - 12 x 3 = - 33 5 x 1 + 5x 2 + 7x 3 = 24 x 1 + 4x 3 = 5 First, form the augmented matrix, [- 7 - 6 - 12 - 33 5 5 7 24 1 0 4 5 \n ] \nand work to reduced row-echelon form, first with j = 1, \n R 1 -R 3 ------ \n [ 1 0 4 5 5 5 7 24 - 7 - 6 - 12 - 33 \n ] - 5 R 1 +R 2 ------- \n [ 1 0 4 5 0 5 - 13 - 1 - 7 - 6 - 12 - 33 \n ] \nSSR R E F B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 30 \n -^7 -R-^1 +--R-^3 \n   \n 1 0 4 5 0 5 - 13 - 1 0 - 6 16 2 \n   \nNow, with j = 2, \n(^15) R 2 ----   1 0 4 5 0 1 - 513 - 51 0 - 6 16 2   (^) -^6 -R-^2 -+-R-^3   1 0 4 5 0 1 - 513 - 51 (^0 0 2545)   And finally, with j = 3, (^52) R 3 ----   1 0 4 5 0 1 - 513 - 51 0 0 1 2   (^135) R 3 +R 2 -------   1 0 4 5 0 1 0 5 0 0 1 2   - 4 R 3 +R 1 -------   1 0 0 - 3 0 1 0 5 0 0 1 2   This is now the augmented matrix of a very simple system of equations, namely x 1 = -3, x 2 = 5, x 3 = 2, which has an obvious solution. Furthermore, we can see that this is the only solution to this system, so we have determined the entire solution set, S = {[ - 3 5 2 ]} You might compare this example with the procedure we used in Example US. 4 Archetypes A and B are meant to contrast each other in many respects. So let us solve Archetype A now.
